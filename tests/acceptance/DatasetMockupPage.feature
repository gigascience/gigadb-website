Feature: A curator opens the mockup page
  As a curator
  I want to see my changes appear in the pre-publication view of the dataset page
  So that I can confirm the changes are correct and show the relevant users the private mockup page displaying the correct information

  Background:
    Given I have signed in as admin
    And I am on "/dataset/200070/token/ImP3Bbu7ytRSfYFh"

  @ok
  Scenario: Dataset metadata changes
    Given I make an update to the non-public dataset "200070"'s "dataset metadata" in the admin pages
    When I am on "/adminDataset/update/id/668"
    And I follow "Open Private URL"
    Then I am on "/dataset/200070/token/ImP3Bbu7ytRSfYFh"
    And I can see the changes to the "dataset metadata" displayed

  @ok
  Scenario: Sample metadata changes
    Given sample "154" is associated with dataset "2000070"
    And I am on "/dataset/200070/token/ImP3Bbu7ytRSfYFh"
    And I make an update to the non-public dataset "200070"'s "sample metadata" in the admin pages
    When I am on "/adminDataset/update/id/668"
    And I follow "Open Private URL"
