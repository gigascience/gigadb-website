    And I should not see "Geographic location (country and/or sea,region):Antarctica, Inexpressible Island, Ross Sea"
    And I should not see "Alternative names:PYGAD"
    And I should see "... +"

  Scenario: sample attributes show long description when clicking +
    Given I am on "/adminDatasetSample/admin"
    When I follow "+"
    Then I should see "Source material identifiers:David Lambert & BGI"
    And I should see "Geographic location (country and/or sea,region):Antarctica, Inexpressible Island, Ross Sea"
