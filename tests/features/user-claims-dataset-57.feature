Feature: a user can claim his/her datasets
	As a gigadb user,
	I want to claim datasets that I've authored
	So I can manage them

Background:
	Given Gigadb web site is loaded with "gigadb_testdata.pgdmp" data
	And user "joy_fox" is loaded
	And default admin user exists

@ok
Scenario: Give users a button to claim a dataset they have authored
	Given I sign in as a user
	When I am on "/dataset/100002"
	Then I should see "Your dataset?"

@ok
Scenario: Non logged-in visitors should not see the button
	Given I am not logged in to Gigadb web site
	When I am on "/dataset/100002"
	Then I should not see "Your dataset?"


@ok @javascript
Scenario: a user is shown a modal to claim his/her dataset by reconcilling his/her author identity to his/her account
	Given I sign in as a user
	And dataset author "stephen_h_black" is loaded
	And I am on "/dataset/100002"
	When I follow "Your dataset?"
	# Then the response should contain "Select an author to link to your Gigadb User ID"
	And I wait "2" seconds
	Then I should see "David M Lambert"
	And I should see "Jun Wang"
	And I should see "Guojie Zhang"
	And I should see "Stephen Henry Black"
	And I should see "0000-0002-5486-853X"
