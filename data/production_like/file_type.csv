1,Readme,A text document describing the data/files available from the GigaDB FTP server for this dataset.,
4,Coding sequence,Predcited protein-coding regions (CDS or exon) or open reading frames in nucleotide sequences.,operation_0436
5,Protein sequence,"One or more protein sequences, possibly with associated annotation. Usually translations of coding region predictions.",data_2976
6,Annotation,"This Is a broad concept and covers all files containing annotation of something, this could be sequence features, or image features or many other things. If possible a more specific type should be used.",none
7,Other,to be used when no appropriate file type is available,none
9,Genome sequence,"nucleotide sequence file, these could be filtered or raw, but usually GigaDB only hosts processed sequence files, the raw should be deposited in the SRA",data_2977
10,SNPs,"A specific subset of sequence variants. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and associated data, for example, the discovery and annotation of SNPs. A SNP is a DNA sequence variation where a single nucleotide differs between members of a species or paired chromosomes in an individual.",topic_2277
12,ISA-Tab,Files generated by the ISA-tools,
13,Software,"a file that is executable in some way, this includes files that are integral parts of other executable files (i.e. all files in a software package are included in this type.)",
25,Text,free text,data_3671
28,16S rRNA,a file containing 16S rRNA sequence(s),
41,Image,"Biological or biomedical data has been rendered into an image, typically for display on screen.",data_2968
58,Directory,"The name of a directory containing one or more files, usually the directory name will provide some indication of the content (either sample name or data type).",data_1049
61,Galaxy workflow,the workflow file generated by Galaxy tools,
73,Repeat sequence,This includes long terminal repeats (LTRs); sequences (typically retroviral) directly repeated at both ends of a defined sequence and other types of repeating unit. Repetitive elements within a nucleic acid sequence.,topic_3126
113,Script,"includes text files of command lines used to run software applications, as well as more complex scripts such as R, perl and python scripts.",
115,Optical map,"a file containing optical map data, usually a TSV file of restriction enzyme fragment lengths (estimated by an optical mapping tool such as Argus)",
125,Mixed archive,a compressed file containing a collection of data files of mixed types,none
126,GitHub archive,a compressed file containing all the files available from a particular GitHub repo on a particular date (usually taken at the time of review of the associated manuscript),
131,Tabular data,Tabular data represented as tab-separated values in a text file.,format_3475
132,Sequence assembly,"An assembly of fragments of a (typically genomic) DNA sequence. Typically, an assembly is a collection of contigs (for example ESTs and genomic DNA fragments) that are ordered, aligned and merged. Annotation of the assembled sequence might be included.",data_0925
