1,1,1,100043,Bisulfite-PCR combined with cloning Sanger sequencing data for validating DNA methylation level in <em>Trichinella spiralis</em>.,"<em>Trichinella spiralis</em> is the smallest nematode parasite of humans and is also infectious in the rat, pig and bear species. Responsible for the disease trichinosis, it is often referred to as the “pork worm” due to infection usually being caused by the consumption of undercooked pork products. Adults mature in the intestines of an intermediate host, and each female produces batches of larvae that bore through the intestinal wall and the lymphatic system. They are then carried to striated muscle where they encyst.
To date 5&#39;-cytosine methylation (5mC) has not been reported in <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em>, and using ultra-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) the existence of DNA methylation in <em>T. spiralis</em> was detected, making it the first 5mC reported in any species of nematode. Technological advances now enable the high-resolution detection of 5&#39;-cytosine methylation, providing a stronger basis for examining the role of DNA methylation in eukaryotic genomes such as these. 
Using MethylC-seq, here we present the first comprehensive study that confirms the existence of DNA methylation in the parasitic nematode, <em>T. spiralis</em> and we characterised the methylomes during the three life-cycle stages of this food-borne infectious parasite of humans. We generated 61.65, 23.52 and 55.77 million raw reads, almost all of which (96.36%, 91.30% and 99.27%, respectively) were able to be aligned to the <em>T. spiralis</em> reference sequence, yielding 2.91, 1.05 and 2.71 Gb of DNA sequence data for the three life-cycle stages. To further validate the DNA methylation level we randomly selected genomic regions and performed Bisulfite-PCR combined with cloning Sanger sequencing. This additional data further supports the existence of DNA methylation in the parasitic nematode, <em>T. spiralis</em>.",348160,ftp://climb.genomics.cn/pub/10.5524/100001_101000/100043/,Published,GigaDBUploadForm_ParasiticNematode.xls,4968b6a3df8e2f82030d98be10bbfdbf,2012-10-08,,1,,,,,

The data here include the an updated metagenome gene catalog, metagenome assemblies, genetic and functional markers associated with T2D, and a novel form of marker- a Metagenomic Linkage Marker (MGL), that allows taxonomic species-level analyses without the need to identify, isolate, and culture novel bacterial species.
Bacterial DNA was extracted from faecal samples and subjected to unbiased, whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing using the Illumina GAIIx and HiSeq2000. In summary, 145 samples were sequenced in stage I and 378.4 Gb of paired-end (PE) sequence data were generated; 200 samples were sequenced in stage II and 830.8 Gb of PE sequence data were generated, as well as 23 additional samples for a validation study on gut-microbiota-based T2D classification. By combining MetaHIT data and our sequence data in stage I we constructed an updated human gut microbial gene catalogue, which contained 4.3 million genes suitable for studies on Chinese individuals. In this updated gene catalogue, 21.3%, 47.1% and 60.9% of genes could be assigned to known genera, KEGG and eggNOG database respectively. Taking this gene catalogue as a reference, we identified gene, KO and OG markers, respectively, which seemed to be strongly associated with T2D in our two-stage case-control study, and 47 Metagenomic Linkage Groups (MLGs). These MLGs were further assembled into different contig sets, which could provide useful genetic, functional, and taxonomic information for the relevant bacterium.

One sample has been selected from the non-reproductive female at Rio Abajo Breeding Facility in Puerto Rico (IACUC#201109.1), and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq platform with both fragment and paired-end sequencing approaches, resulting in a total of 42,479,499,706 bases. We predicted a total coverage depth of 26.89X of the parrot’s genome: 17.08X coverage for the short fragment reads, and 9.8X coverage for the mate pairs. The sequencing was initiated with the construction of two genome libraries: a short fragment library (~300 bp inserts) for sequencing the majority of the genome, and a long fragment library (~2.5 Kb inserts) to generate scaffolds to be used to order and assemble contigs derived from the short fragment library. The Illumina paired-end and mate-pairs reads were assembled together with Ray (<a href=""http://denovoassembler.sourceforge.net"">http://denovoassembler.sourceforge.net</a>), with the k-mer defined iteratively. In total, given that the genome size is predicted to be 1.58Gb, with the total scaffold length of 1,184, 594,388 bp, the overall coverage of the genome is around 76%, a value that might be slightly overestimated given that some of the scaffolds may be overlapping but could not be assembled.

An organism with a mid-range genome size (~432 Mb), it often serves as a model insect for the order Lepidoptera.  A number of wild varieties of silkworms exist as well, including the Chinese wild silkworm (<em>Bombyx mandarina</em>) from which the domesticated silkworm originated.
Each of the silkworm varieties was sequenced to ~3X coverage, representing 99.88% of the genome.  These sequences were then used to create a single-base pair resolution genetic variation map of the silkworm.  SNP sets were obtained separately for the pool of 29 domesticated strains and the pool of 11 wild varieties.  The number of SNPs in the domestic versus wild varieties was approximately 14 million and 13 million, respectively.  In addition to SNPs, approximately 0.33 million small insertion-deletions (indels) and 35 thousand structural variants (SVs) were identified among the 40 varieties.  Over three-fourths of the SVs overlapped with transposable elements.
A total of 1,041 candidate regions Genomic Regions of Selective Signals (GROSS) were identified.  These regions cover 12.5 Mb (2.9%) of the genome and may reflect genomic footprints left by artificial selection during domestication, as they include 354 protein-coding genes that were identified as good candidates for domestication genes.
We observed that 159 genes from GROSS were expressed in on different B. mori tissues on day 3 of the fifth larval instar as a reference strain, and were enriched in tissues of silk gland, midgut, and testis.  The genes expressed in silk gland are involved in the synthesis of silk proteins, including fibroin and sericin.  Midgut-enriched genes are related to the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids and lipids.

Grain and sweet sorghums differ in a number of important traits including stem sugar and juice accumulation, plant height, and the production of grain and biomass.  The first sorghum whole-genome sequences are now available for analysis, but additional genomic sequences will be required to study genome-wide and intraspecific variation for dissecting the genetic basis of these important traits and for tailor-designed breeding of this important C4 crop.
In a joint effort with scientists from the Institute of Botany of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Beijing) and Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory (Singapore), BGI resequenced two sweet and one grain sorghum inbred lines: E-Tian, Ji2731, and Keller.  E-Tian (literally meaning Russian Sweet in Chinese) is a sweet sorghum line introduced into China in the early 1970’s. Ji2731 is a Chinese kaoliang grain sorghum that is well adapted to Northeast China.  Keller is an American-bred elite sweet sorghum line shown to perform well across a wide range of environmental conditions.
Using the re-sequencing data, a set of nearly 1,500 genes differentiating sweet and grain sorghum were identified.  These genes fall into 10 major metabolic pathways involved in sugar and starch metabolisms, lignin and coumarin biosynthesis, nucleic acid metabolism, stress responses and DNA damage repair.  In addition, 1,057,018 SNPs, 99,948 indels of 1-10bp in length and 16,487 presence/absence variations were uncovered, and 17,111 CNVs were detected.  The majority of the SNPs, large-effect SNPs, indels and presence/absence variations resided in genes containing leucine rich repeats, PPR repeats and disease resistance R genes possessing diverse biological functions or under diversifying selection, but were absent in genes which are essential for life.

The genome sequence of T. tengcongensis was decoded in 2001, comprising 2.69 Mb in length and containing 2,588 predicted proteins. Previous studies of the proteomic response to growth temperature changes and thermo-survival of T. tengcongensis have been carried out with 2DE and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. However, due to limitations of the technique, only few proteins with semi-quantitative estimation for the differential 2DE spots responsive to temperature changes are obtained.
An improved iTRAQ-based quantification proteomics protocol has been developed, and using this method data produced to analyze the T. tengcongensis cultured at four temperatures: 55, 65, 75, and 80 oC. In order to obtain reproducible data, two biological replicates and multiple technical replicates (four times for the first sample preparation and three times for the second one) were carried out. Using the iTRAQ labeled sample analyzing procedure of high-pH RP HPLC coupled with LTQ Orbitrap Velos MS, 732,234 MS/MS spectra in total were obtained. The raw data were searched by Mascot 2.3, approximately 23% of the spectra were matched to peptides (FDR<0.01), while 0.5% less of the identified peptides were absent with the reporter tags. In total, 1,589 proteins elicited from 13,223 unique peptides, were identified with quantitative information, which covered 61.4% of the 2,588 predicted proteins of the T. tengcongensis genome. To study the abundance correlation between protein and mRNA, RNA-seq was carried out to study the transcription of the different cultured samples. Using Illumina HiSeqTM 2000 sequencing and the analyzing the raw data using SOAP2, the RNA-seq data covered approximately 97% (2501/2588) of the predicted genes, with more than two reads for each gene. These two datasets help show that the temperature-dependent responses of transcription and translation can happen in synchrony.

Five task-related fMRI time series (finger, foot and lip movement, overt verb generation, covert verb generation, overt word repetition, and landmark tasks) were used to investigate which protocols gave reliable single-subject results. Ten healthy participants in their fifties were scanned twice using an identical protocol 2-3 days apart. In addition to the fMRI sessions, high-angular resolution diffusion tensor MRI (DTI), and high-resolution 3D T1-weighted volume scans were acquired.
Each subject was assigned a random, unique identifier using the DICOM confidential de-identification toolkit to replace their name and any other medical identification information. DICOM files for each scanning sequence were anonymized according to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act guidelines, and DICOM to NIfTI conversion was performed using the dcm2nii tool. To prevent visual identification, the 3D T1-weighted volumes have been defaced using mri_deface. Seven NIfTI files are provided for each subject/session: five 4D fMRI, one 4D DTI, and one 3D T1-weighted volume scan.
Due to the fact that the overt language tasks were scanned using sparse sampling, we were able to record and analyze each subject’s responses (not included due to privacy concerns). This analysis lead to exclusion of one session of one subject of the overt word repetition task, due to the fact that the subject failed to perform the task correctly. Data and its description are arranged according to the OpenfMRI layout. Together, this dataset provides a unique opportunity to investigate the reliability of different fMRI tasks, as well as methods and algorithms used to analyze, de-noise and combine fMRI, DTI and structural T1-weighted volume data.

They have an advanced ability of vocal learning. Parrots can imitate human speech, synchronize their body movements to a rhythmic beat, and understand complex concepts of referential meaning to sounds.

<br><b>Findings:</b> Here we present a genomic resource for the budgerigar, an Australian Parakeet (<i>Melopsittacus undulatus</i>) that is the most widely used parrot species for studying vocal learning. Specifically, we present the genomic reads, four high quality annotated assemblies and optical maps. This sequence reads were in part used for the Assemblathon 2 competition (see dataset <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.5524/100060"" target=""_blank"">doi:10.5524/100060</a>).

To explore the relevant molecular events, we used the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) coupled with shotgun proteomics technique (iTRAQ/Shotgun) to study the proteomic changes of rice embryos during embryogenesis. For the first time, a total of 2,165 unique proteins were identified in rice embryos by using the Q-Exactive Mass spectrometry, and the abundances of 867 proteins were actively changed based on statistical evaluation towards the quantitative MS/MS signals. The quantitative data were then confirmed by using multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) conducted on Qtrap 5500 Mass spectrometry. To make the study reproducible by others, all of the raw Q-Exactive and Qtrap 5500 data had been deposited in the GigaScience database (GigaDB).

62,57,61,100049,Metacellulosomics data demonstrating synergism in a soil-derived cellulose-degrading microbial community.,"Currently available enzyme technology is insufficient to economically degrade plant biomass, and presumably will remain so until we reach a comprehensive understanding of how nature solves this problem. Here we show that a microbial consortium enriched from soil establishes collaborative relationships to enable efficient hydrolysis of plant polysaccharides. Analyses of reconstructed bacterial draft genomes from all seven uncultured phylotypes in the consortium show that these microbes cooperate in both cellulose-degrading and other important metabolic processes. Experimental evidence  for cellulolytic inter-species synergies came from the discovery of cellulosome structures composed of subunits from different phylotypes. Oxygen consumption by specific phylotypes enables anaerobic saccharification, whereas inferred utilization of the resulting metabolites by non-cellulolytic phylotypes negates their accumulation and associated negative effects towards cellulose degradation. These collaborative microbial actions illustrate that efficient biomass conversion in nature relies on a high level of microbial community organization.

The work focuses on the processing of big networks for multi-species AFP using single off-the-shelf computers, a very difficult and in most case unfeasible task, due to the main memory limitations of ordinary computers.
The proposed algorithmic “vertex-centric” approach solves “locally” the AFP problem, by processing iteratively only small parts of the overall network, while still exploiting the global topology of the network.
The computation is based on novel secondary memory-based technologies to overcome the main memory limitation of ordinary off-the-shelf computers.
As an example, to show the feasibility and effectiveness of the  proposed approach, 2 networks were  constructed  and analyzed. The results are contained here.

140,152,72,101042,Long-branch attraction,"Background
Most previous studies of morphological and molecular data have consistently supported the monophyly of the true water bugs (Hemiptera: Nepomorpha). An exception is a recent study by Hua et al. (2009; BMC Evol Biol 9: 134) based on nine nepomorphan mitochondrial genomes. In the analysis of Hua et al. (2009), the water bugs in the group Pleoidea formed the sister group to a clade that consisted of Nepomorpha (the remaining true water bugs) + Leptopodomorpha (shore bugs) + Cimicomorpha (assassin bugs and relatives) + Pentatomomorpha (stink bugs and relatives), thereby suggesting that fully aquatic hemipterans evolved independently at least twice. Based on these results, Hua et al. (2009) elevated the Pleoidea to a new infraorder, the Plemorpha. 
Results
Our reanalysis suggests that the lack of support for the monophyly of the true water bugs (including Pleoidea) by Hua et al. (2009) likely resulted from inadequate taxon sampling. In particular, long-branch attraction (LBA) between the distant outgroup taxa and Pleoidea, as well as LBA among taxa in the ingroup, made Nepomorpha appear to be polyphyletic. We used three complementary strategies to test and alleviate the effects of LBA: (1) the removal of distant outgroups from the analysis; (2) the addition of closely related outgroups; and  (3) the addition of a mitochondrial genome from a second family of Pleoidea. We also performed likelihood-ratio tests to examine the support for monophyly of Nepomorpha with different combinations of taxa included in the analysis. Furthermore, we found that specimens of Helotrephes sp. were misidentified as Paraplea frontalis (Fieber, 1844) by Hua et al. (2009).
Conclusions
All analyses that included the addition of more taxa significantly and consistently supported the placement of Pleoidea within the Nepomorpha (i.e., supported the monophyly of the traditional true water bugs). Our analyses further support a close relationship between Notonectoidea and Pleoidea within Nepomorpha, and the superfamilies Nepoidea, Ochteroidea, Naucoroidea, and Pleoidea are resolved as monophyletic in all trees with strong support. Our results also confirmed that monophyly of Nepomorpha clearly is not refuted by the mitochondrial genome data.",1000,ftp://site,Incomplete,,,,,,,,,,
141,151,139,100092,MicroCT scans of freshly fixed and museum earthworm specimens.,"Micro-computed tomography (µCT), a digital X-ray-based imaging technique, has developed into an important tool for the study of animal morphology. Although molecular tools are increasingly employed to decipher invertebrate systematics, earthworm (<em>Annelida: Clitellata: &#39;Oligochaeta&#39</em>) taxonomy is still largely based on conventional dissection, resulting in data that are mostly unsuitable for dissemination through online databases. In order to evaluate if µCT in combination with soft tissue staining techniques could be used to expand the existing set of tools available for studying internal and external structures of earthworms, µCT scans of freshly fixed and museum specimens were collected.<br>
Scout images revealed full penetration of tissues by the staining agent. The attained isotropic voxel resolutions permit identification of internal and external structures conventionally used in earthworm taxonomy. The projection as well as the reconstruction images are archived here and are publicly available for download.<br>
The dataset presented shows that earthworms constitute suitable candidates for μCT scanning in combination with soft tissue staining. Not only are the data comparable to results derived from traditional dissection techniques, but they also permit interactively exploring earthworm morphology and anatomy. The approach pursued here can be applied to freshly fixed as well as museum specimens, which is of particular importance when considering the use of rare or valuable museum material.<br>

Rice, <em>Oryza sativa L.</em>, is the staple food for half the world’s population. By 2030, rice production must increase by at least 25% to keep pace with population growth. Accelerated genetic gains in rice improvement are needed to mitigate the effects of climate change and loss of arable land and to ensure global food supply.<br>
Here, we include data from an international effort resequencing a core collection of 3,000 rice accessions from 89 countries as a global public good. The 3,000 sequenced rice genomes had an average sequencing depth of 14X, average genome coverage and mapping rates of 94.0% and 92.5%, respectively.<br>
This data provides a foundation for large-scale discovery of novel alleles for important rice phenotypes using various bioinformatics and/or genetic approaches. It also serves to understand at a higher level of detail the genomic diversity within <em>O. sativa</em>. With the release of the sequencing data, the project calls for the global rice community to take advantage of this data as a foundation for establishing a global, public rice genetic/genomic database and information platform for advancing rice breeding technology for future rice improvement.<br>

Linear regression is employed for this purpose, and in recent years a signal-processing paradigm known as compressed sensing (CS) has coalesced around a particular class of regression techniques. CS is not a method in its own right, but rather a body of theory regarding signal recovery when the number of predictor variables (i.e., genotyped markers) exceeds the sample size. The paper shows the applicability of compressed sensing (CS) theory to genome-wide association studies (GWAS), where the purpose is to ﬁnd trait-associated tagging markers (genetic variants). Analysis scripts are contained in the compressed CS file. Mock data and scripts are found in the compressed GD file.

149,261,152,100100,"Software and supporting material for: ""SmileFinder: a resampling-based platform to evaluate signatures of selection from genome-wide sets of matching allele frequency data between populations"".","<em>SmileFinder</em> is a simple program that looks for the sweep patterns left by historic selection in genome-wide allele frequency datasets by evaluating the diversity and difference between two or more populations of diploid species against the neutral expectation. The program calculates the mean of heterozygosity and of variance in fixation index (F<sub>ST</sub>) in a set of sliding windows of incrementally increasing sizes, and then builds a resampled distribution (the baseline) of random multi-locus sets matched to the sizes of sliding windows, using an unrestricted sampling. Percentiles of the values in the sliding windows are derived from the superimposed resampled distribution. The resampling can easily be scaled from 1K to 100M times; the higher the  number the more precise the percentiles ascribed to the extreme observed values.   <br>
The output from <em>SmileFinder</em> can be used to plot percentile values to look for  signatures of selection along chromosome maps, or to compare lists of candidate genes to random gene sets to test for the overrepresentation of sweeps.  Both uses of the algorithms have already been implemented in published studies.  This publicly available, open source program  should become a useful tool for preliminary scans of selection using worldwide databases of human genetic variation as well as population datasets for many non-human species from which such data is rapidly emerging with the advent of the new genotyping and sequencing technologies.

151,226,153,100101,"A comprehensive resource of genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic sequencing data of black truffle, <em>Tuber melanosporum</em>.","<em>Tuber melanosporum</em>, a plant-symbiotic macrofungus and a highly appreciated gastronomic delicacy (“truffle”), features one of the largest fungal genomes (125 Mb) with an exceptionally high transposable element (TE) and repetitive DNA content (>58%). The main purpose of DNA methylation in fungi is TE silencing. As obligate outcrossing organisms, truffles are bound to a sexual mode of propagation, which together with TEs is thought to represent a major force driving the evolution of DNA methylation. It was thus of interest to examine if and how <em>T. melanosporum</em> exploits DNA methylation to maintain genome integrity.<br>
We performed whole-genome DNA bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) and mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on different developmental stages of <em>T. melanosporum</em>; namely, fruitbody (“truffle”), free-living mycelium and ectomycorrhiza. The data revealed a high rate of cytosine methylation (>44%), selectively targeting TEs rather than genes with a strong preference for CpG sites. Whole genome DNA sequencing (WG-seq) uncovered multiple TE-enriched, copy number variant regions bearing a significant fraction of hypomethylated and expressed TEs, almost exclusively in <em>in-vitro</em> propagated free-living mycelium. Treatment of mycelia with 5-azacytidine partially reduced DNA methylation and increased TE transcription. Our transcriptome assembly also resulted in the identification of a set of novel transcripts from 614 genes.
The present datasets provide valuable and comprehensive (epi)genomic information that can be of interest for evolutionary genomics studies of multicellular (filamentous) fungi, in particular Ascomycetes belonging to the Pezizomycotina.

154,242,158,100102,Bacterial whole-genome read data from the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION™ nanopore sequencer.,"The MinION is a new, portable single-molecule sequencer developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies. It measures four inches in length and is powered from the USB 3.0 port of a laptop computer. By measuring the change in resistance produced when DNA strands translocate through and interact with a protein nanopore the device is able to deduce the underlying nucleotide sequence.
<br>
Here we present a read dataset from whole-genome shotgun sequencing of the model organism Escherichia coli K-12 substr. MG1655 generated on a MinION device with R7 chemistry during the early-access MinION Access Program (MAP).
 <br>
Three sequencing runs of the MinION were performed using R7 chemistry. The first run produced 43,656 forward reads (272Mb), 23,338 (125Mb) reverse reads, 20,087 two-direction (2D) reads (131Mb), of which 8% (10Mb) were full 2D. Full 2D reads means that the complementary strand was successfully slowed through the pore.
<br>
The R7 protocol has a modification to increase the relative number of full 2D reads (NONI). To exploit this, two new libraries were produced which included an overnight incubation stage (ONI-1 and ONI-2). Each library was run on an individual flow cell. This resulted in 6,534 & 8,260 forward reads, 2,171 & 2,945 reads and 1,740 & 2,394 2D reads (27%, 29%). In this case, 50% and 41.8% of reads were full 2D respectively. The mean fragment lengths for 2D reads from the three libraries were 6,543 (NONI) 6,907 (ONI-1) and 6,434 (ONI-2).
<br>
A fourth run was performed using a further modified chemistry (R7.3), which resulted in 39819 forward reads, 18889 complement reads, of which 11823 and 9563 were 2D and full 2D respectively. <br>
Raw and assembled sequence data is provided to demonstrate the nature of data produced by the MinION™ platform and to encourage the development of customised methods for alignment and variant calling, de novo assembly and scaffolding. FAST5 files containing event data within the HDF5 container format are provided to assist with the development of improved base-calling methods.

Outbreaks of it have re-occurred approximately every three years in Asia. It has also been used as a model system for ecological studies and for developing effective pest management.<br>
The N. lugens population sequenced in the present study was originally collected in Hangzhou, China, in 2008 and had been reared on rice seedlings (strain: TN1). One male and one female were isolated and mated to produce F1 progeny. A single pair was then selected for sibling inbreeding for 13 generations. Genomic DNA was extracted from adult females of the F13 generation. We constructed a series of DNA libraries with varying insert sizes (180 bp, 200 bp, 500 bp, 2 kb, 5 kb, 10 kb, 20 kb, and 40 kb) to perform WGS sequencing. All of the above libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2000 or GA-II sequencers. After performing filtering steps to remove adapter-contaminated reads, low-quality reads, and duplicate reads, a total of 158.01 Gbp of clean WGS data (131.67X of the genome) with 131.7-fold of genome coverage depth and were combined with 507.94 Gbp of clean fosmid sequence data was obtained. This was assembled using SOAPdenovo and Rabbit, producing a final draft assembly of 1.141Gbp with a scaffold N50 of 356,597 bp. The Nilaparvata lugens genome should highlight potential directions for effective pest control of the planthopper.

When this microbial ecosystem becomes disrupted, the health of the human host can suffer, a condition called dysbiosis. However, the community compositions of the human microbiomes also vary dramatically from individual to individual and over time, making it difficult to uncover the underlying mechanisms linking microbiome to human health. We propose that a microbiome’s interaction with its human host is not necessarily dependent upon the presence or absence of particular bacterial species, but instead is dependent on the community metabolome of microbiome, an emergent property of microbiome.<br>Using data from a previously published, longitudinal study of human gut microbiome populations, we extrapolated information about microbiome community enzyme profiles and metabolome models.

Many tools exist for identification of single nucleotide polymorphism (snps), small indels and large deletions based on DNA re-sequencing strategy. However, those approaches consistently display significant bias for recovery of complex structural variants and novel sequence in the individual genomes and lack sequence interpretation such as ancestral state and mechanism. Here we present a novel approach implemented in a single software package, AsmVar, to discover, genotype and characterize different forms of structural variants and novel sequence in population-scale de novo assemblies at single nucleotide resolution. Our approach displays good scalability and makes it applicable for investigations in large population studies of species with complex genomes, such as homo sapiens. Application of AsmVar to several human de novo assemblies captures a wide spectrum of structural variants and novel sequences present in the human population with high sensitivity and specificity. Our method provides a direct solution to investigate the structural variations and novel sequences from <em>de novo</em> assemblies, which is important for construction of population-scale pan genome.

This technology has demonstrated a great potential, especially in genome-wide analyses. In this study, we tested the ability of the MinION system to perform amplicon sequencing in order to design new approaches to study microbial diversity using nearly full-length 16S rDNA sequences.<br>
Using the R7.3 chemistry, we generated more than 3.8 million events (nt) during a single sequencing run. This data was sufficient for reconstruction of more than 90% of the 16S rRNA gene sequences for 20 different species present in a mock community used as a reference. After read mapping and 16S rRNA gene assembly, consensus sequences and 2d reads were recovered to make taxonomy assignments down to the species level.  Additionally, we were able to measure the relative abundance of all the species present in a mock community and detected a biased species distribution originating from the PCR reaction using ""universal"" primers.<br>
Although nanopore-based sequencing produces reads with lower per-base accuracy in comparison with other platforms, the MinION DNA sequencer is valuable for both high taxonomic resolution and microbial diversity analysis. Improvements of the nanopore chemistry will further deliver more reliable information useful for the specific detection of microbial species and strains in complex ecosystems as a consequence of minimizing the basecalling errors and nucleotide bias as that reported here for 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing.",1073741824,ftp://climb.genomics.cn/pub/10.5524/100001_101000/100185/,Published,100185newversion.xls,8ecbf97a12c79b3806645723578b53b0,2016-01-14,,3,dNf0PeVT5ImWz1sE,,,,

241,473,255,100183,"Supporting data for ""Scalable linkage disequilibrium-based selective sweep detection: a performance guide"".","Linkage disequilibrium is defined as the non-random associations of alleles at different loci, and it occurs when genotypes at the two loci depend on each other. The model of genetic hitchhiking predicts that strong positive selection affects the patterns of linkage disequilibrium around the site of a beneficial allele, resulting in specific motifs of correlations between neutral polymorphisms that surround the fixed beneficial allele. Linkage disequilibrium is built upon each side of a beneficial allele and diminishes for sites that are across the selected allele. This specific pattern of linkage disequilibrium occurs more frequently when positive selection has acted on the population rather than under various neutral models. Thus, detecting such patterns could accurately reveal targets of positive selection along a recombining chromosome or a genome. Calculating linkage disequilibria in whole genomes is computationally expensive since correlations of alleles need to be evaluated for millions of pairs of sites. To analyze large datasets efficiently, algorithmic implementations employed in modern population genetics need to exploit multiple cores of current workstations in a scalable way. <br>
Population genomic datasets come in different types and shapes while typically exhibiting SNP density heterogeneity. Due to such peculiarities, the implementation of generally scalable parallel algorithms is a challenging task. In this work, we present a series of four parallelization strategies targeting shared-memory systems for the computationally intensive problem of detecting genomic regions that have contributed to the past adaptation of the species, also referred to as selective sweep, based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns. We provide a thorough performance evaluation of the proposed parallel algorithms for computing LD and outline the benefits of each approach. Furthermore, we
compare our open-source software OmegaPlus to a variety of neutrality tests.<br>
The computational demands of selective sweep detection algorithms can vary significantly depending on a variety of attributes such as the SNP density heterogeneity, and the analysis of DNA or binary data due to the finite or infinite site models, respectively. Choosing the right parallel algorithm for the analysis can lead to significant processing time reduction as well as major energy savings. However, which parallel algorithm is going to execute more efficiently on a specific processor architecture and number of available cores for a particular dataset is not straightforward.",1048576,ftp://climb.genomics.cn/pub/10.5524/100001_101000/100183/,Published,100183newversion.xls,60d864c63f435640d8ebe26e9462690c,2016-02-05,,3,onvmT7CIjHGZkgdz,,,,

We have sequenced and assembled (<em>de novo</em>) the transcriptome of <em>S. solidus</em> using whole organisms from three key developmental stages involved in host transitions: immature plerocercoid, mature plerocercoid and adult. Recent publications in parasitology, and more specifically on host-parasite interactions, have been strongly focused towards reviews and development of ideas and theoretical frameworks, but empirical data acquisition is still lagging behind. The main objective underlying the publication of this data is to increase the amount of publicly available resources for host-parasite systems. <br>
Our <em>de novo</em> assembly pipeline for the transcriptome of <em>Schistocephalus solidus</em> allowed us to reconstruct 24,765 high-confidence, non-redundant transcripts, associated with 10,285 unique genes. In total 7,323 unique genes (71%) were assigned at least one gene ontology (GO) term, and 4,270 (35%) were assigned at least one KEGG pathway ID. Phylogenetic relationships with other parasitic and non-parasitic worm species were investigated, allowing the identification of 1,977 genes that are specific to <em>S. solidus</em>, 3,425 core orthologs shared only among parasites and 6,892 putative orthologs shared among all worm species included in the analysis. <br>
Accessibility to high-quality genetic resources for a wide panel of host-parasite systems is fundamental not only to the advancement of knowledge on the mechanisms of host-parasite interactions, but also on the evolution of complex life cycles and parasitism itself.

When those steps have been described in sufficient detail that others can retrace the steps and obtain similar results, the research is said to be reproducible. Computers play a vital role in many research disciplines and present both opportunities and challenges for reproducibility. Computers can be programmed to execute analysis tasks, and those programs can be repeated and shared with others. Due to the deterministic nature of most computer programs, the same analysis tasks, applied to the same data, will often produce the same outputs. However, in practice, computational findings often cannot be reproduced due to complexities in how software is packaged, installed, and executed—and due to limitations in how scientists document analysis steps. Many tools and techniques are available to help overcome these challenges. Here we describe seven such strategies.

276,613,289,100215,Dataset collection from the 2015 Brainhack Proceedings,"Brainhack - a novel conference model for the open neuroscience research community - exploded in 2015. With three-day <a href=""http://events.brainhack.org/"">events</a> in Honolulu (June), Montréal (July), and across the Americas (eight participating sites in October), a community that first began only a few years ago around the shared spirit of collaboration and an ethos of open science has taken resolute form.<br> 
As Brainhack events were founded on the principle that content should emerge through the onsite interaction of participants, the innovative event structure demanded a different publication form. Inverting the model of conference proceedings, where submissions are triaged in preparation for the meeting, we developed the Brainhack Proceedings to rather mark the achievements, outputs, and ideas that emerged as the meeting&#39;s result. 
Post-conference papers were solicited from participants at any of the events held in 2015. All submissions were peer-reviewed in the Brainhack Proceedings <a href=""https://github.com/Brainhack-Proceedings-2015""> Github repository</a> using an innovative open-review process. In keeping with the culture of Brainhack, we took advantage of the open platform provided by Github to encourage a productive dialogue between authors and reviewers. <br>
This first issue of Brainhack Proceedings includes 23 project papers - presenting an overview of the broad range of interests, content, and achievements that converged at Brainhack events this past year. <br>Here we present an archival copy of the data generated during the event, it should be noted that many of these projects are ongoing and for the most upto date versions readers are directed to the relevant GitHub repository as listed in each GigaDB dataset:

277,416,290,100209,De novo sequencing of <em>Ginkgo biloba</em>,"<em>Ginkgo biloba</em> is one of the world’s most ancient plants,  a living fossil that has remained essentially unchanged in terms of gross morphology for more than 200 million years. Representing one of the four extant gymnosperm lineages and having no living relatives, it possesses a suite of fascinating characteristics including including a large genome, outstanding resistance/tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses, and dioecious reproduction, making it an ideal model species for biological studies. However, the lack of a high-quality genome sequence has been an impediment to our understanding of its biology and evolution.
<br>
Here, we assembled and annotated the first complete genome sequence of ginkgo, which will will aid related research. Genomic DNA was extracted from endosperm tissue from ginkgo seeds that develop directly from female gametophytes without fertilization and thus contain haploid genomes without undergoing genetic recombination. Multiple seeds at visually different developmental stages were collected from five separate large ginkgo trees at one of the ginkgo refuge populations located on Tianmu Mountain, Zhejiang Province, China. All paired-end libraries and one mate-pair library (2  kb) were constructed using DNA extracted from a single seed. Data were generated using a Hiseq 2000/4000 platform from 1253.09 Gb clean data. The resulting assembled 10.61 Gb genome sequence contained 41,840 annotated genes, with N50 values of 48.2 kb for contigs and 1.36 Mb for scaffolds, respectively. Repetitive sequences account for 76.58 % of the assembled sequence, and long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) are particularly prevalent.",5368709120,ftp://climb.genomics.cn/pub/10.5524/100001_101000/100209/,Pending,100209newversion.xls,1c8faee1bd2e53d0dc03953861854012,,,3,dBHKnFVy4wDQI6sO,,,,
278,616,291,100216,Distributed collaboration: the case for the enhancement of Brainspell’s interface,"The past several decades have seen an explosive growth in the number of published neuroimaging studies. In concert, the demand for freely available and openly accessible ‘study data’, that would facilitate future reanalysis, meta-analysis, hypothesis testing and repurposing has also soared.

The software framework makes it easy to add new data sources, simple to define and to provide access to multiple datasets from a single data source. Software dependencies are managed on a per-dataset basis, allowing downloads and examples to use any public packages without requiring installation of packages required by unused datasets. The interface also allows selective download of data (by subject or type) and caches files locally, allowing easy management of big datasets. <br>We focused on exposing new methods for downloading data from the HCP, supporting access via Amazon S3 and HTTP/XNAT. We were able to provide a downloader that accepts login credentials and downloads files locally. We created an example that interacts with DIPY to produce diffusion imaging results on a single subject from the HCP. We also worked at collecting common data sources, as well as individual datasets stored at each data source, into NiData’s “data sources” wiki page.

280,618,293,100218,Integrating the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard into C-PAC,"Data acquired during neuroimaging experiments can be organized in many ways. This stems from differences in scanner software, various DICOM and NIFTI tools, and custom data organizing scripts within different laboratories. The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) specification provides a simple, straightforward solution to this problem by introducing an intuitive standard for neuroimaging data organization. The widespread adoption of BIDS can be facilitated through incorporating this standard into software projects used for neuroimaging analysis. These software packages will in turn benefit from the homogenous data structure and ease of specifying data acquisition parameters afforded by BIDS. The goal of this Brainhack project was to integrate BIDS into the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC) a python software built on Nipype  for the high-throughput analysis of resting state fMRI data. <br>The updated C-PAC GUI reflects the “BIDS” and “Custom” options, with the “Custom” option allowing users to specify their data structure as in previous versions of C-PAC. In the future this option would be more elegantly displayed via a radio button with the input fields dynamically changing to reflect the type of input desired. <br>Incorporating the BIDS subject list builder into C-PAC is a great step forward in bringing the standard to a broader audience. Throughout the integration process, other technologies were discovered that could further enable input data gathering across a wide range of file system types, including FTP, SFTP, Zip, S3, and an array of virtual filesystems. With further development, the overhead of preprocessing ones own neuroimaging data for discovery science can be minimized so scientists can focus on the results.",104857600,ftp://climb.genomics.cn/pub/10.5524/100001_101000/100218/,Published,100218newversion.xls,dbc1bea6ae04e06884e46c1b7b769d9d,2016-10-21,,3,VoEHywL5ptNh3fU8,,,,
281,613,294,100219,Optimized implementations of voxel-wise degree centrality and local functional connectivity density mapping in AFNI,"Degree centrality (DC) and local functional connectivity density (lFCD) are statistics calculated from brain connectivity graphs that measure how important a brain region is to the graph. DC (a.k.a. global functional connectivity density) is calculated as the number of connections a region has with the rest of the brain (binary DC), or the sum of weights for those connections (weighted DC). lFCD was developed to be a surrogate measure of DC that is faster to calculate by restricting its computation to regions that are spatially adjacent. Although both of these measures are popular for investigating inter-individual variation in brain connectivity, efficient neuroimaging tools for computing them are scarce. The goal of this Brainhack project was to contribute optimized implementations of these algorithms to the widely used, open source, AFNI software package. <br>Tools for calculating DC (3dDegreeCentrality) and lFCD (3dLFCD) were implemented by modifying the C source code of AFNI’s 3dAutoTcorrelate tool. 3dAutoTcorrelate calculates the voxel voxel correlation matrix for a dataset and includes most of the functionality we require, including support for OpenMP multithreading to improve calculation time, the ability to restrict the calculation using a user-supplied or auto-calculated mask, and support for both Pearson’s and Spearman correlation. <br>Outputs from the newly developed tools were benchmarked to Python implementations of these measures from the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC) using the publically shared Intrinsic Brain Activity Test-Retest (IBATRT) dataset from the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility.",104857600,ftp://climb.genomics.cn/pub/10.5524/100001_101000/100219/,Published,100219newversion.xls,a3be3848818b4433c7ece6ec7379a34c,2016-10-21,,3,54nyvSd3M9VkWZRK,,,,

Currently, a simple and efficient interface for the anonymization of such imaging datasets, which works on all operating systems and is very light in terms of dependencies, is not available. <br>Here, we created a DICOM anonymizer that is a simple graphical tool that uses <a href=https://github.com/darcymason/pydicom target=_blank>PyDICOM</a> package to anonymize DICOM datasets easily on any operating system, with no dependencies except for the default Python and NumPy packages.

283,620,296,100221,Automatic extraction of academic collaborations in neuroimaging,"Our ability to quantitatively study large-scale social and behavioural phenomena such as peer influence and confirmation bias within scientific circles rest on quality and relevant data. Yet the compilation of specific coauthorship databases are often restricted to certain well-defined fields of study or publication resources, limiting the extent and depth by which investigations can be performed. Ultimately, we aim to understand how the social construct and its underlying dynamics influence the trajectories of scientific endeavors. This work is motivated by an interest in observing social patterns, monitoring their evolution, and possibly understanding the emergence and spreading of ideas and their biases in the neuroimaging community; central themes to deciphering facts from opinions. However, before being able to fully investigate and address these fundamental and inherently complex questions, we need to address the extraction and validation of data. The goal of this project was to leverage publicly available information on Google Scholar (GS) to automatically extract coauthorship networks. <br>The tool can be accessed through a public <a href=http://cos.dery.xyz target=_blank>website</a>. The site is constructed using a set of openly accessible libraries allowing the display of coauthorship networks as interactive graphs.

289,626,302,100227,"DueCredit: automated collection of citations for software, methods, and data","Data analysis software and canonical datasets are the driving force behind many fields of empirical sciences. Despite being of paramount importance, those resources are most often not adequately cited. Although some can consider this a “social” problem, its roots are technical: Users of those resources often are simply not aware of the underlying computational libraries and methods they have been using in their research projects. This in-turn fosters inefficient practices that encourage the development of new projects, instead of contributing to existing established ones. Some projects (e.g. FSL) facilitate citation of the utilized methods, but such efforts are not uniform, and the output is rarely in commonly used citation formats (e.g. BibTeX). DueCredit is a simple framework to embed information about publications or other references within the original code or dataset descriptors. References are automatically reported to the user whenever a given functionality or dataset is being used.<br>DueCredit is currently available for Python, but we envision extending support to other frameworks (e.g., Matlab, R). Until DueCredit gets adopted natively by the projects, it provides the functionality to “inject” references for 3rd party modules.<br>For the developer, DueCredit implements a decorator @due.dcite that allows to link a method or class to a set of references that can be specified through a doi or BibTeX entry. <br>The initial release of DueCredit (0.1.0) was implemented during the OHBM 2015 hackathon and uploaded to pypi and is freely available. DueCredit provides a concise API to associate a publication reference with any given module or function. DueCredit comes with a simple demo code, which demonstrates its utility. <br>DueCredit is in its early stages of development, but two days of team development at the OHBM hackathon were sufficient to establish a usable prototype implementation. Since then, the code-base was further improved and multiple beta-releases followed, expanding the coverage of citable resources (e.g., within scipy, sklearn modules via injections and PyMVPA natively).",104857600,ftp://climb.genomics.cn/pub/10.5524/100001_101000/100227/,Published,100227newversion.xls,e893f31cc243aee2b64b93d4eff73aaf,2016-10-27,,3,UIG54vgeLrpkKRcM,,,,
290,627,303,100228,Open source low-cost device to register dog’s heart rate and tail movement,"In dogs, the perception of an important stimulus can be related to physiological changes such as the heart rate (e.g., in socioemotional situations with humans or dogs) and the movement of their tail (for example, tail-wagging has a bias that depends on the nature of the stimulus, a bias to the left is related to a withdrawal tendency and a bias to the right is related to an approach tendency ).<br>Although heart rate and the tail movement are important gateways to understanding dog cognition, just a few studies report these variables. Perhaps this is related to the difficulty of obtaining records of these variables in natural environments (e.g., parks), the elevated cost of commercial data acquisition hardware (around 5,000 USD) or by nonexistence of a tail-movement registering device. For these reasons, the goal of this brainhack project is to design and build a low cost device able to register the heart rate and changes in the tail movement in dogs, both in laboratory and in free movement conditions.<br>We decided to base our design in Arduino hardware for its accessibility and broad use. <br>In order to assess if the device could reliably get readings from a dog, we tested it in three phases: baseline, stimulation/no-stimulation and free movement. All phases lasted two minutes and were repeated twice on two dogs. In both, baseline and stimulation/no-stimulation, the dog stayed in sphinx position without movement restrictions but under the command “stay”. The stimulation/no-stimulation phase consisted in three interleaved repetitions of two types of conditions, stimulation and no-stimulation, each repetition lasted 20s. In the stimulation condition the dog owner showed the dog a treat and mentioned the dog’s name. In the free movement condition, the dog walked down a street without any specific command.<br>
The results showed that the device could be used to distinguish between two different stimulation conditions. In the stimulation/no-stimulation phase a Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test revealed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between the beats per minute, beat amplitude and the tail movement amplitude.<br>
By matching the data collected with observations of the movement of the tail, we notice that the data reflects the position of the tail but its resolution depended on the position of the electrode. The data acquired from the free movement condition was affected by the movement and did not seem reliable for testing.<br>We were able to build and test a non-invasive low cost device with the capacity to register the heart rate and the tail movement of dogs. We consider that the addition of a movement sensor could provide additional data to reduce the change on the signal due to movement.<br>This device can be integrated in future research on dog cognition. It can also be used in shelters and homes to easily measure the responses that dogs present to different sets of stimuli; for example, when a dog is left alone in its house and shows stress (i.e. increased heart rate, preferential tail movement to the left) the dog’s care giver could make changes in the environment to increase the well-being of the dog.<br>The low cost and the easy access to the materials needed to build the device make it a feasible option to study dog cognition.

291,628,304,100229,Calculating the Laterality Index Using FSL for Stroke Neuroimaging Data,"The laterality index (LI) is one way to assess hemispheric dominance in a variety of tasks, such as language, cognitive functions, and changes in laterality in clinical populations, such as after stroke. In stroke neuroimaging, however, an optimal method of calculating the LI remains controversial, largely due to lesion variability in post-stroke brains.<br>Two main methods of calculating LI have evolved in neuroimaging literature  The first, more traditional approach counts the number of active voxels in a given region of interest (ROI) for each hemisphere. This method has been criticized for its inability to account for differences in signal intensity. Hence, a second approach calculates laterality based on the percent signal change within a given region; however, this method also has problems, such as difficulty handling negative values.<br>A laterality toolbox that addresses some of these issues has been implemented in the statistical neuroimaging analysis package SPM, which provides users with options of using either method, along with more advanced statistical tests for robust LI calculations  No such toolbox is yet available for FSL. Therefore, we developed a series of scripts to calculate LI in FSL using both voxel count and percent signal change methods. However, in the interest of space, here we present only results from the more robust method of the two (voxel count method).<br>We used fMRI data from two groups of stroke participants who either had right or left hemisphere lesions. Participants observed videos of right or left hand actions, and resulting statistical maps were calculated for each individual. The LI was then calculated per participant, based on the number of active voxels within a given anatomically-defined ROI (the inferior frontal gyrus, pars opercularis). <br>We suggest that stroke neuroimaging might benefit from calculating an average LI across different thresholds (including more lenient thresholds such as z=1.0), in order to provide a more robust outcome that takes into account threshold dependency. This is especially true for individuals with cortical strokes, where the ROI may overlap with the lesion and yield 0 active voxels. This issue of thresholding, specifically for stroke research, is an interesting question that remains to be addressed further.

292,629,305,100230,Wrapping FreeSurfer 6 for use in high-performance computing environments,"The purpose of this project is to wrap the recon-all workflow from FreeSurfer 6.0 beta in a Python processing framework for neuroimaging data called Nipype. FreesSurfer, an image analysis suite, performs cortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation. FreeSurfer’s recon-all workflow provides researchers a simple interface for automatically processing of MRI data. Currently recon-all makes command-line program calls to other FreeSurfer processes from a tcsh script. Nipype offers a framework in python for making command-line program calls that will allow for faster processing in a high-performance computing environment. This will allow high-performance computing environments to execute steps of the workflow that are independent of each other to be run in parallel. The wrapping of the workflow in Nipype will also allow for easier manipulation of the individual steps in the workflow.<br>FreeSurfer’s recon-all tcsh workflow was used to process a set of MRI images. Recon-all then output a list of commands used to process the MRI data. The output commands were placed in a Nipype workflow. If a command did not have a pre-existing Nipype interface, then one was created. In order to ensure that the two workflows were analogous the Nipype and the tcsh workflow were run on the same set of MRI images and the outputs were compared. The comparisons were carried out with SimpleITK for image files and VTK for surface files.<br>All output images and surfaces from FreeSurfer’s recon-all were identical to those of the Nipype workflow. The stats files were also shown to be equivalent. Less significant files, such as log files, were either not thoroughly compared or were not output by the Nipype workflow.<br>The created Nipype workflow was shown to be analogous to pre-existing FreeSurfer tcsh workflow. With further development, Nipype could serve as a complete replacement to the tcsh workflow. This would allow for easier development of the workflow by researchers. Thorough testing on the processing times of the workflows in a high performance environment has not yet been evaluated, but it is hypothesized that the Nipype workflow will perform much faster. The collaborations at the 2015 OHBM BrainHack meeting were instrumental in accomplishing this task.

For instance, if a reliable relationship between brain structure after stroke and functional motor ability was established, brain imaging could be used to predict prognosis/recovery potential for individual patients.

294,631,307,100232,A cortical surface-based geodesic distance package for Python,"The human cerebral cortex, whether tracing it through phylogeny or ontogeny, emerges through expansion and progressive differentiation into larger and more diverse areas. While current methodologies address this analytically by characterizing local cortical expansion in the form of surface area, several lines of research have proposed that the cortex in fact expands along trajectories from primordial anchor areas and furthermore, that the distance along the cortical surface is informative regarding cortical differentiation . We sought to investigate the geometric relationships that arise in the cortex based on expansion from such origin points. Towards this aim, we developed a Python package for measuring the geodesic distance along the cortical surface that restricts shortest paths from passing through nodes of non-cortical areas such as the non-cortical portions of the surface mesh described as the “medial wall’.<br>The calculation of geodesic distance along a mesh surface is based in the cumulative distance of the shortest path between two points. The first challenge that arises is the sensitivity of the calculation to the resolution of the mesh: the coarser the mesh, the longer the shortest path may be, as the distance becomes progressively less direct. This problem has been previously addressed and subsequently implemented in the Python package <a href=https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gdist/ target=_blank>gdist</a>, which calculates the exact geodesic distance along a mesh by subdividing the shortest path until a straight line along the cortex is approximated. <br>The second challenge, for which there was no prefabricated solution, was ensuring that the shortest path only traverses territory within the cortex proper, avoiding shortcuts through non-cortical areas included in the surface mesh — most prominently, the non-cortical portions along the medial wall. Were the shortest paths between two nodes to traverse non-cortical regions, the distance between nodes would be artificially decreased, which would have artifactual impact on the interpretation of results. This concern would be especially relevant to the ‘zones analysis’ described below, where the boundaries between regions would be altered. It was therefore necessary to remove mesh nodes prior to calculating the exact geodesic distance, which requires reconstructing the mesh and assigning the respective new node indices for any seed regions-of-interest.<br>Finally, to facilitate applications to neuroscience research questions, we enabled the loading and visualization of data from commonly used formats such as FreeSurfer and the Human Connectome Project (HCP). A Nipype pipeline for group-level batch processing has also been made available . The pipeline is wrapped in a command-line interface and allows for straightforward distance calculations of entire FreeSurfer-preprocessed datasets. Group-level data are stored as CSV files for each requested mesh resolution, source label and hemisphere, facilitating further statistical analyses.<br>The resultant package, SurfDist, achieves the aforementioned goals of faciliating the calculation of exact geodesic distance on the cortical surface. We present here the distance measures from the central and calcarine sulci labels on the FreeSurfer native surfaces. The distance measure provides a means to parcellate the cortex using the surface geometry. Towards that aim, we also implement a ‘zones analysis’, which constructs a Voronoi diagram, establishing partitions based on the greater proximity to a set of label nodes.<br>The SurfDist package is designed to enable investigation of intrinisic geometric properties of the cerebral cortex based on geodesic distance measures. Towards the aim of enabling applications specific to neuroimaging-based research question, we have designed the package to facilitate analysis and visualization of geodesic distance metrics using standard cortical surface meshes.",104857600,ftp://climb.genomics.cn/pub/10.5524/100001_101000/100232/,Published,100232newversion.xls,59a9297f1cc2fc3aa63b32243bd029fd,2016-10-31,,3,TS8xfrvAYQO5hWKZ,,,,

296,633,309,100234,Detecting task-based fMRI compliance using plan abandonment techniques,"Task-based fMRI is a powerful approach to understand brain processes for a certain task. However, fMRI images are usually preprocessed hours, days or even months after the scan. During the functional image preprocessing stage, defects in images are detected and, in some cases, cannot be corrected. For example, technical problems with the scanner or lack of collaboration from the subject to perform the given tasks. For these cases it is necessary to realize a new scan. In order to mitigate lost scans due to patient non-compliance, we need an approach to detect such non-compliance during the scan.<br>In this BrainHack project, we aim to detect if a subject is following the given task and provide an almost real-time feedback to the researchers to make a decision during the exam if the subject is not collaborating. This is necessary to be performed in order to avoid loss of data, in which the images are typically processed and quality assessed at another day. We will focus on task where there are no button responses from the subject, hence relying solely in the BOLD signal if the subject is collaborating. To do so, we use plan abandonment techniques  a sub-area of Artificial Intelligence. For a given fMRI paradigm, a plan should be created and compared with the subject’s brain activation during the scan using recognition methods. To use plan abandonment techniques, we need to discretize and formalize the fMRI and construct a expected plan based on the hypothesized paradigm using this formalization. To evaluate the compliance with a specific paradigm, we aim to use real-time fMRI methods to retrieve BOLD signals of brain regions that are supposed to be active in a particular time range. In order to tolerate fluctuations of the BOLD signal, we aim to use the methods that detect non-compliance using a threshold from the expected activation . By doing so, it is possible to detect if a subject is following the paradigm given a specific stimulus type, such as visual or auditory stimulus. The brain state of each stimulus type will be mapped based on atlas from the literature. For example, to cover motor activations, Brodmann area 4 will be mapped with a state motor_actv. Thus, for a paradigm that works with motor tasks, the plan must contain motor_actv for the given time that the task occurs.<br>The formalization of brain states strongly depends on the discretization of specific region states, which might vary from subject to subject. In order to normalize the signals, a previous tuning phase is required with simple paradigms, depending on which paradigm will be executed. During the scan, an online normalization must be made to a standard space, such as the MNI brain space. This real-time processing is required to map expected active regions to the previously selected brain areas from an atlas.<br>The usage of real-time fMRI methods aggregates to our approach since the tuning and pursuance recognition can be made during the exam. Such real-time fMRI methods can also monitor movements during the scan in order to identify if there is too much subject movement. In the case of fMRI paradigm abandonment, the paradigm can be adapted to induce or interest the subject in a way that the subject proceeds with its tasks, using methods such as demonstrated by . Neurofeedback can be used to sustain the subject’s interest by letting the paradigm be more challenging, requiring more attention and collaboration from the patient.<br>This project is in its initial phase. Real-time fMRI methods are being tested, using AFNI’s provided tools. In order to use plan abandonment techniques, the next step is to formalize basic stimuli types based on mapped regions. By using these formalizations, paradigms can be converted to a problem of plan abandonment and it becomes possible to evaluate the participation of a subject during the scan.",104857600,ftp://climb.genomics.cn/pub/10.5524/100001_101000/100234/,Published,100234newversion.xls,daccdbe6913899b4a520cd1d7e8e5fa1,2016-11-01,,3,6hMGBCnTPUuygNvW,,,,

Though, self-organizing systems typically possess a large number of components and exhibit complex dynamics, their evolution is deterministic and governed by a small number of order parameters. This property is used here to model the self-organization of the ocular dominance columns of the striate cortex in patterns of neighboring stripes, which respond preferentially to inputs from the left or the right eye. Therefore, the Swift-Hohenberg equation was used which depends on two order parameters. The first one determines the spatial wavelength λ of the stripes and the second one the branchiness є of the pattern.  This simple model suffices to study the basic properties of ocular dominance self-organization. Possibly, a combination with models for self-organization in neighboring cortical layers would allow investigating higher organizational principles of the cortex, e.g. the coordination between ocular dominance, orientation, and cytochrome oxidase.",104857600,ftp://climb.genomics.cn/pub/10.5524/100001_101000/100235/,Published,100235newversion.xls,0f8ccdcd46b34dc5a96f33b824036649,2016-11-01,,3,NeJu8X73rBzq5QRV,,,,

NIDM provides a community-based framework for developing data exchange standards that describe the primary observations, computational workflows, and derived results of neuroimaging studies. For example, a researcher sharing a statistical brain map could include with the brain map a data structure, “NIDM Results”, that contains complete information about the parameters used to generate the result, significant coordinate points in the brain map paired with test criteria, along with other meta-data exported from the software that generated it. This additional information cannot be represented in the brain map itself, and provides a complete description of the result that can be compared to other results, or used to reproduce it.<br>While work is underway to integrate NIDM into the software used by the human brain mapping community, only low-level tools are currently available to access and query NIDM documents that rely on a graph-based representation called the Resource Description Framework (RDF) . Further, technologies like RDF and the corresponding query language, SPARQL  pose a steep learning curve for users of standard Web development workflows. With the recent migration of tools for neuroimaging meta analysis, sharing, and visualization into the Web browser, Web developers will be incentivized by the ability to easily integrate brain data into Web applications using familiar languages and formats. The goal of this Brainhack project was to develop infrastructure to serve NIDM documents and queries using an API with a syntax that allows for the easy development of Web-based tools for the neuroimaging community.

This project includes two components. First, the (a href=https://github.com/incf-nidash/nidm-api target=_blank>nidm-api</a> is a Python-based executable that works both as a command-line tool to run queries over NIDM documents, as well as to serve a RESTful API to allow a local or cloud-based server to execute queries on documents accessible by URL. Second, nidm-query [https://github.com/incf-nidash/nidm-query] is a repository of SPARQL queries that the nidm-api application dynamically downloads, validates, and serves upon starting the application. This strategy means that NIDM developers can collaboratively construct SPARQL queries without requiring Web developers to gain expertise in LOD technology. The nidm-api, along with serving the queries, also provides a graphical Web interfaces to contribute new queries to the shared repository. Because the nidm-api is a Python Flask application, it can be used both as an executable to serve the API and contains a set of functions that can be integrated into other Python-based frameworks or cloud platforms that provide Python accessibility. <br>As an example of the type of Web applications that can be built with the NIDM API, the NIDM Results object model was recently integrated into the <a href=http://www.neurovault.org target=_blank>NeuroVault</a> database, meaning that neuroimaging researchers can export results pertaining to statistical brain maps from common software into NeuroVault.

The species Ephedra californica comprises a major proportion of the community within this region and likely also provides key ecosystem services. We used motion sensor trail cameras to examine interactions between animals and these shrubs. This technology is a less invasive alternative to other animal surveying methods such as line transects, radio tracking, and spotlight surveys. Cameras were placed within the shrub understory and in the open (i.e. non-canopied) microhabitats at ground level to estimate animal activity.
<br>
Trail cameras were successful in detecting the presence of animal species at shruband open microhabitats. A total of 20 cameras were deployed from April 1st, 2015 to July 5th, 2015 at paired shrub/open microsites at three locations along Elkhorn Road in Carrizo Plain National Monument (35.1914 N, 119.7929 W). Each independent site was approximately 1 square kilometer. Over 420,000 pictures (both of animals and triggers from vegetation moving in the wind) were taken during this time. The trigger rate was very high on the medium sensitivity camera setting in this desert ecosystem, and the rates did not differ between shrub and open microsites.<br> We reviewed 100,000 of the images for content before uploading them to GigaDB to ensure image quality, presence of animals, date and temperature stamp, and data integrity.
It was found that some of the cameras had not had the date set correctly, users are advised to only use the dates as listed in the sampling metadata table as provided in GigaDB.<br>

We complement existing repositories with manually-corrected brain masks for 125 T1-weighted anatomical scans from the Nathan Kline Institute Enhanced Rockland Sample Neurofeedback Study.<br>
Skull-stripped images were obtained using a semi-automated procedure that involved skull-stripping the data using the brain extraction based on non local segmentation technique (BEaST) software and manually correcting the worst results. Corrected brain masks were added into the BEaST library and the procedure was reiterated until acceptable brain masks were available for all images. In total, 85 of the skull-stripped

Skull-stripped anatomical images from the Neurofeedback sample are available for download from the Preprocessed Connectomes Project. The resulting brain masks can be used by researchers to improve their preprocessing of the Neurofeedback data, and as training and testing data for developing new skull-stripping algorithms and evaluating the impact on other aspects of MRI preprocessing.

However, most of these were sequenced without experimental haplotype data and as such are missing an important aspect of genome biology.  In addition, much of the genomic data generated is not available to the public and lacks phenotypic information.<br>
As part of the Personal Genome Project (PGP), 184 participants’ blood samples were collected and processed with Complete Genomics’ Long Fragment Read (LFR) technology.  Here we report the results for the experimental whole genome haplotyping and sequencing of these samples to an average read coverage depth of 100X of 114 of these samples.  This level of coverage is approximately 3 fold higher than the read coverage applied to most whole human genome assemblies and was done to ensure the highest quality results.  Currently only 114 genomes from this data set are freely available on GigaDB and are associated with rich phenotypic data provided in this manuscript.  It is our expectation that all 184 participants’ genomes will be made freely available in the near future, as soon as the individuals concerned have reviewed their own genomes prior to release in accordance with the PGP agreement. <br>
Twenty genomes were sequenced at least two times using independently made LFR barcoded libraries for reproducibility analyses.  Additionally, 7 genomes were also sequenced using Complete Genomics’ standard non-barcoded library process. <br>
These genomes represent a unique source of haplotype and phenotype data for the scientific community.  In addition, we report 2.6 million high quality rare variants not previously identified in dbSNP or Phase 3 1000 Genomes Project (1KG) data.

Speculation in the literature exists that these climate conditions were associated with the 2015/2016 El Niño event and/or climate change but to date no quantitative assessment has been made. Analysis of related flaviviruses -such as dengue and chikungunya, which are transmitted by the same vectors- suggests that ZIKV dynamics is sensitive to climate seasonality and longer-term variability and trends. A better understanding the climate conditions conducive to the 2014-2016 epidemic may permit the development of climate-informed short- and long-term strategies for ZIKV prevention and control.<br>
Using a novel timescale-decomposition methodology, we demonstrate that extreme climate anomalies observed in most parts of South America during the current epidemic are not caused exclusively by El Niño or climate change -as speculated-, but are the result of a particular combination of climate signals acting at multiple timescales. In Brazil, the heart of the epidemic, we find that dry conditions present during 2013-2015 are explained primarily by year-to-year variability superimposed on decadal variability, but with little contribution of long-term trends. In contrast, the extreme warm temperatures of 2014-2015 resulted from the compound effect of climate change, decadal and year-to-year climate variability.<br>

The influence of such circadian regulation over whole-canopy fluxes remains uncertain and diurnal CO2 and H2O vapor flux dynamics in the field are currently interpreted as resulting almost exclusively from direct physiological responses to variations in light, temperature and other environmental factors. We tested whether circadian regulation would affect plant and canopy gas exchange at the Montpellier European CNRS Ecotron. Canopy and leaf level fluxes were constantly monitored under field-like environmental conditions, and under constant environmental conditions (no variation in temperature, radiation or other environmental cues).<br>
We show direct experimental evidence at canopy scales of circadian regulation of daytime gas exchange: 20-79% of the daily variation range in CO2 and H2O fluxes occurred under circadian entrainment in canopies of an annual herb (bean) and of a perennial shrub (cotton). We also observed that considering circadian regulation improved performance by 8-17% in commonly used stomatal conductance models.<br> 
Our results show that circadian controls affect diurnal patterns of CO2 and H2O fluxes in entire canopies in field-like conditions and its consideration significantly improves model performance. Circadian controls act as a “memory” of the past conditions experienced by the plant that synchronizes metabolism across entire plant canopies.<br>

However, one gecko clade, the Eublepharidae, seems to be the exception to most of these “rules” and lack adhesive toe pads, have eyelids, and lay eggs with soft, leathery eggshells. These differences make eublepharids an important component of any investigation into the underlying genomic innovations contributing to the distinctive phenotypes in “typical” geckos.<br>
We report the high-depth genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation for a male leopard gecko, Eublepharis macularius (Eublepharidae).

307,665,321,100247,"Supporting data for ""Clusterflock: A Flocking Algorithm for Isolating Congruent Phylogenomic Datasets""","Collective animal behavior such as the flocking of birds or the shoaling of fish has inspired a class of algorithms designed to optimize distance-based clusters in various applications including document analysis and DNA microarrays. In the flocking model, individual agents respond only to their immediate environment and move according to a few simple rules. After several iterations the agents self-organize and clusters emerge without the need for partitional seeds. In addition to their unsupervised nature, flocking offers several computational advantages including the potential to decrease the number of required comparisons. 
<br>
In Clusterflock, we implement a flocking algorithm designed to find groups (flocks) of orthologous gene families (OGFs) that share a common evolutionary history. Pairwise distances that measure the phylogenetic incongruence between OGFs guide flock formation. We test this approach on several simulated datasets varying the number of underlying topologies, the proportion of missing data, and evolutionary rates, and show that in datasets containing high levels of missing data and rate heterogeneity, Clusterflock outperforms other well-established clustering techniques. We also demonstrate its utility on a known, large-scale recombination event in Staphylococcus aureus. By isolating sets of OGFs with divergent phylogenetic signal, we can pinpoint the recombined region without forcing a pre-determined number of groupings or defining a pre-determined incongruence threshold.  
<br>
Clusterflock is an open source tool that can be used to discover horizontally transferred genes, recombined areas of chromosomes, and the phylogenetic “core” of a genome. Though we use it in an evolutionary context, it is generalizable to any clustering problem. Users can write extensions to calculate any distance metric on the unit interval and use these distances to “flock” any type of data.

However, the mechanisms through which maternal exercise might promote such effects are not well understood. The present study examined levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and absolute cell num- bers in the hippocampal formation and cerebral cortex of rat pups born from mothers exer- cised during pregnancy. Additionally, we evaluated the cognitive abilities of adult offspring in different behavioral paradigms (exploratory activity and habituation in open field tests, spatial memory in a water maze test, and aversive memory in a step-down inhibitory avoid- ance task). Results showed that maternal exercise during pregnancy increased BDNF lev- els and absolute numbers of neuronal and non-neuronal cells in the hippocampal formation of offspring. No differences in BDNF levels or cell numbers were detected in the cerebral cortex. It was also observed that offspring from exercised mothers exhibited better cognitive performance in nonassociative (habituation) and associative (spatial learning) mnemonic tasks than did offspring from sedentary mothers. Our findings indicate that maternal exer- cise during pregnancy enhances offspring cognitive function (habituation behavior and spa- tial learning) and increases BDNF levels and cell numbers in the hippocampal formation of offspring.

Underlying this diversity in leaf shape are profound changes in the patterning of the primary vasculature and laminar outgrowth. Each of these aspects of leaf morphology—vasculature and blade—provides different insights into leaf patterning.<br>
Here, we morphometrically analyze >3,300 leaves from 40 different Passiflora species collected sequentially across the vine. Each leaf is measured in two different ways: using 1) 15 homologous Procrustes-adjusted landmarks of the vasculature, sinuses, and lobes and 2) Elliptical Fourier Descriptors (EFDs), which quantify the outline of the leaf. The ability of landmarks, EFDs, and both datasets together are compared to determine their relative ability to predict species and node position within the vine. Pairwise correlation of x and y landmark coordinates and EFD harmonic coefficients reveals close associations between traits and insights into the relationship between vasculature and blade patterning.<br>
Landmarks, more reflective of the vasculature, and EFDs, more reflective of the blade contour, describe both similar and distinct features of leaf morphology. Landmarks and EFDs vary in ability to predict species identity and node position in the vine and exhibit a correlational structure (both within landmark or EFD traits and between the two data types) revealing constraints between vascular and blade patterning underlying natural variation in leaf morphology among Passiflora species.
