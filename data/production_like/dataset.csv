2,2,2,100016,Genomic data from the potato. ,"Available here is the genome of the potato (<em>Solanum tuberosum</em> L.), the first genome sequenced from the asterid clade.  Potato is a member of the Solanaceae, a plant family that includes many other economically important species, such as tomato, petunia, eggplant, tobacco, and pepper.  As the potato is both clonally propagated and the world;s most important non-grain food crop, its genome is a valuable agricultural resource.

The Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium sequenced two species: the heterozygous diploid <em>S. tuberosum</em> Group Tuberosum cultivar, RH89-039-16 (RH), and the doubled monoploid <em>S. tuberosum</em> Group Phureja clone DM1-3 516R44 (DM).  The potato genome consists of 12 chromosomes, of which over 80% of the homozygous clone’s 844-megabase genome were assembled.  Genome analysis revealed evidence of at least two genome duplication events and identified a number of asterid-specific genes.  Comparison between the two clones identified frequent gene variations and mutations, which may cause inbreeding depression.",501437432,ftp://climb.genomics.cn/pub/10.5524/100001_101000/100016/,Published,GigaDBUploadForm_Potato.xls,e0032a377dc01d2c425b7887e66ab368,2011-11-12,,1,QWxyaI12rZni0uOe,,,,
5,5,5,100039,Genomic data of the Puerto Rican Parrot (<em>Amazona vittata</em>) from a locally funded project. ,"These data represent the first assembly of a genome sequence for a critically endangered parrot (<em>Amazona vittata</em>) endemic to the United States, and also the first genome of a species from the diverse and ecologically important genus <em>Amazona</em> native to South America and the Caribbean. One sample has been selected from the non-reproductive female at Rio Abajo Breeding Facility in Puerto Rico (IACUC#201109.1), and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq platform with both fragment and paired-end sequencing approaches, resulting in a total of 42,479,499,706 bases. We predicted a total coverage depth of 26.89X of the parrot’s genome: 17.08X coverage for the short fragment reads, and 9.8X coverage for the mate pairs. The sequencing was initiated with the construction of two genome libraries: a short fragment library (~300 bp inserts) for sequencing the majority of the genome, and a long fragment library (~2.5 Kb inserts) to generate scaffolds to be used to order and assemble contigs derived from the short fragment library. The Illumina paired-end and mate-pairs reads were assembled together with Ray (<a href=""http://denovoassembler.sourceforge.net"">http://denovoassembler.sourceforge.net</a>), with the k-mer defined iteratively. In total, given that the genome size is predicted to be 1.58Gb, with the total scaffold length of 1,184, 594,388 bp, the overall coverage of the genome is around 76%, a value that might be slightly overestimated given that some of the scaffolds may be overlapping but could not be assembled. Filtering followed by assembly resulted in 259,423 contigs (N50=6,983 bp, longest = 75,003 bp), which was further combined into 148,255 scaffolds (N50 = 19,470, longest = 206,462 bp).

<br>
With its status as one of the adorable and cuddly flightless birds of Antarctica, they serve as an example for conservation, and as a result they are now categorised at low risk for endangerment.  The sequence of the penguin can be of use in understanding the genetic underpinnings of its evolutionary traits and adaptation to its extreme environment; its unique system of feathers; its prowess as a diver; and its sensitivity to climate change.  We hope that this genome data will further our understanding of one of the most remarkable creatures to waddle the planet Earth.<br> We sequenced the genome of an adult male from Inexpressible Island, Ross Sea, Antartica (provided by David Lambert) to a depth of approximately 60X with short reads from a series of libraries with various insert sizes (200bp- 20kb).

We proposed to rebuild the avian phylogenetic tree by using whole genome data, thus we have collected genomes of 48 bird species, representing 36 orders of bird class. The chicken, zebrafinch, and turkey genomes, which were sequenced in Sanger method, were collected from public domain. Another three genomes, pigeon, peregrine falcon, and Beijing duck, have been published during the development of this project.

The data posted here include the full genome assemblies of 45 bird species, the repeat and gene annotation produced by our new pipeline, 8295 1:1 syntenic orthologous genes, and the whole genome alignment data for all bird species. The detailed information of the published genomes can be accessed from their own publications. The genomes first released here were sequenced and assembled with NGS technology in whole genome shotgun strategy. Using an homology-based method, we annotated 13000~17000 protein-coding genes in each avian genome.

However, the identification of genome structural variations based on NGS approaches with read lengths of 35 to 300 bases remains to be a challenge. Single molecule optical mapping technologies allow the analysis of DNA molecules of up to 2 Mb and are very suitable for the identification of large scale genome structural variations and for de novo genome assemblies when combined with short read NGS data. Here we present the optical mapping data of two human genomes: the HapMap cell line GM12878 and the colorectal cancer cell line HCT116. <br>
High molecular weight DNA was obtained by embedding GM12878 and HCT116 cells, respectively, in agarose plugs followed by DNA extraction under mild conditions. We digested genomic DNA with KpnI and analyzed 310,000 and 296,000 DNA molecules (≥ 150 kb and 10 restriction fragments), respectively, per cell line using the Argus optical mapping system.

We have sequenced and assembled (<em>de novo</em>) the transcriptome of <em>S. solidus</em> using whole organisms from three key developmental stages involved in host transitions: immature plerocercoid, mature plerocercoid and adult. Recent publications in parasitology, and more specifically on host-parasite interactions, have been strongly focused towards reviews and development of ideas and theoretical frameworks, but empirical data acquisition is still lagging behind. The main objective underlying the publication of this data is to increase the amount of publicly available resources for host-parasite systems. <br>
Our <em>de novo</em> assembly pipeline for the transcriptome of <em>Schistocephalus solidus</em> allowed us to reconstruct 24,765 high-confidence, non-redundant transcripts, associated with 10,285 unique genes. In total 7,323 unique genes (71%) were assigned at least one gene ontology (GO) term, and 4,270 (35%) were assigned at least one KEGG pathway ID. Phylogenetic relationships with other parasitic and non-parasitic worm species were investigated, allowing the identification of 1,977 genes that are specific to <em>S. solidus</em>, 3,425 core orthologs shared only among parasites and 6,892 putative orthologs shared among all worm species included in the analysis. <br>
Accessibility to high-quality genetic resources for a wide panel of host-parasite systems is fundamental not only to the advancement of knowledge on the mechanisms of host-parasite interactions, but also on the evolution of complex life cycles and parasitism itself.

261,562,275,100195,Examplar data demonstrating the improvement of genome assembly and annotation by using AGOUTI.,"Genomes sequenced using short-read, next-generation sequencing technologies are error-filled and fragmented into thousands of small contigs. These incomplete and fragmented assemblies lead to errors in gene identification, such that single genes spread across multiple contigs are annotated as separate gene models. Such biases can confound inferences about the number of genes within species, as well as gene gain and loss between species.
We present AGOUTI (Annotated Genome Optimization Using Transcriptome Information), a tool that uses RNA-seq data to simultaneously combine contigs into scaffolds and fragmented gene models into single models.  We show that AGOUTI improves both the contiguity of genome assemblies and the accuracy of gene annotation, providing updated versions of each as output. Running AGOUTI on a simulated dataset, we show that it is highly accurate and that it achieves higher accuracy and contiguity compared to other existing methods.

304,642,318,100243,"Supporting data for ""Analyzing climate variations on multiple timescales can guide Zika virus response measures""","The emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) as a public health emergency in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) occurred during a period of severe drought and unusually high temperatures. Speculation in the literature exists that these climate conditions were associated with the 2015/2016 El Niño event and/or climate change but to date no quantitative assessment has been made. Analysis of related flaviviruses -such as dengue and chikungunya, which are transmitted by the same vectors- suggests that ZIKV dynamics is sensitive to climate seasonality and longer-term variability and trends. A better understanding the climate conditions conducive to the 2014-2016 epidemic may permit the development of climate-informed short- and long-term strategies for ZIKV prevention and control.<br>
Using a novel timescale-decomposition methodology, we demonstrate that extreme climate anomalies observed in most parts of South America during the current epidemic are not caused exclusively by El Niño or climate change -as speculated-, but are the result of a particular combination of climate signals acting at multiple timescales. In Brazil, the heart of the epidemic, we find that dry conditions present during 2013-2015 are explained primarily by year-to-year variability superimposed on decadal variability, but with little contribution of long-term trends. In contrast, the extreme warm temperatures of 2014-2015 resulted from the compound effect of climate change, decadal and year-to-year climate variability.<br>
