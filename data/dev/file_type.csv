1,Readme,A text document describing the data/files available from the GigaDB FTP server for this dataset.,
4,Coding sequence,Predcited protein-coding regions (CDS or exon) or open reading frames in nucleotide sequences.,operation_0436
5,Protein sequence,"One or more protein sequences, possibly with associated annotation. Usually translations of coding region predictions.",data_2976
6,Annotation,"This Is a broad concept and covers all files containing annotation of something, this could be sequence features, or image features or many other things. If possible a more specific type should be used.",none
7,Other,to be used when no appropriate file type is available,none
41,Image,"Biological or biomedical data has been rendered into an image, typically for display on screen.",data_2968
73,Repeat sequence,This includes long terminal repeats (LTRs); sequences (typically retroviral) directly repeated at both ends of a defined sequence and other types of repeating unit. Repetitive elements within a nucleic acid sequence.,topic_3126
113,Script,"includes text files of command lines used to run software applications, as well as more complex scripts such as R, perl and python scripts.",
125,Mixed archive,a compressed file containing a collection of data files of mixed types,none
132,Sequence assembly,"An assembly of fragments of a (typically genomic) DNA sequence. Typically, an assembly is a collection of contigs (for example ESTs and genomic DNA fragments) that are ordered, aligned and merged. Annotation of the assembled sequence might be included.",data_0925
