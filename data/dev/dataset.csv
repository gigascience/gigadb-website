5,345,5,100039,Genomic data of the Puerto Rican Parrot (<em>Amazona vittata</em>) from a locally funded project. ,"These data represent the first assembly of a genome sequence for a critically endangered parrot (<em>Amazona vittata</em>) endemic to the United States, and also the first genome of a species from the diverse and ecologically important genus <em>Amazona</em> native to South America and the Caribbean. One sample has been selected from the non-reproductive female at Rio Abajo Breeding Facility in Puerto Rico (IACUC#201109.1), and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq platform with both fragment and paired-end sequencing approaches, resulting in a total of 42,479,499,706 bases. We predicted a total coverage depth of 26.89X of the parrot’s genome: 17.08X coverage for the short fragment reads, and 9.8X coverage for the mate pairs. The sequencing was initiated with the construction of two genome libraries: a short fragment library (~300 bp inserts) for sequencing the majority of the genome, and a long fragment library (~2.5 Kb inserts) to generate scaffolds to be used to order and assemble contigs derived from the short fragment library. The Illumina paired-end and mate-pairs reads were assembled together with Ray (<a href=""http://denovoassembler.sourceforge.net"">http://denovoassembler.sourceforge.net</a>), with the k-mer defined iteratively. In total, given that the genome size is predicted to be 1.58Gb, with the total scaffold length of 1,184, 594,388 bp, the overall coverage of the genome is around 76%, a value that might be slightly overestimated given that some of the scaffolds may be overlapping but could not be assembled. Filtering followed by assembly resulted in 259,423 contigs (N50=6,983 bp, longest = 75,003 bp), which was further combined into 148,255 scaffolds (N50 = 19,470, longest = 206,462 bp). The database contains all of the contigs, scaffolds, corresponding assembly parameters, and the annotations for the known repeats and coding sequences. The assembled scaffolds allow basic genomic annotation and comparative analyses with other available avian whole-genome sequences.",4294967296,ftp://climb.genomics.cn/pub/10.5524/100001_101000/100039/,Incomplete,GigaDBSubmissionForm_Parrot.xls,1586ed77abdec5b9f839be0f5d61f357,2012-09-11,2012-09-14,1,,,,,
8,8,8,100006,Genomic data from Adelie penguin (<em>Pygoscelis adeliae</em>). ,"The Adelie penguin (<em>Pygoscelis adeliae</em>) is an iconic penguin of moderate stature and a tuxedo of black and white feathers.  The penguins are only found in the Antarctic region and surrounding islands.  Being very sensitive to climate change, and due to changes in their behavior based on minor shifts in climate, they are often used as a barometer of the Antarctic.<br>With its status as one of the adorable and cuddly flightless birds of Antarctica, they serve as an example for conservation, and as a result they are now categorised at low risk for endangerment.  The sequence of the penguin can be of use in understanding the genetic underpinnings of its evolutionary traits and adaptation to its extreme environment; its unique system of feathers; its prowess as a diver; and its sensitivity to climate change.  We hope that this genome data will further our understanding of one of the most remarkable creatures to waddle the planet Earth.<br> We sequenced the genome of an adult male from Inexpressible Island, Ross Sea, Antartica (provided by David Lambert) to a depth of approximately 60X with short reads from a series of libraries with various insert sizes (200bp- 20kb).

It is primarily grown in temperate, subtropical and tropical areas.  With approximately 6,000 varieties, millet is one member of the Panicoideae (grasses subfamily), which includes maize (<em>Zea mays</em>), sorghum (<em>Sorghum bicolor</em>), and sugar cane (<em>Saccharum officinarum</em>).  It is a nutritious dietary staple, containing starch, proteins, and a number of vitamins and minerals, such as calcium, iron, and sodium.  It feeds nearly one-third of the world population with main daily-calories intake, and is especially prevalent in dry climates or soil-poor regions that are not suited for the cultivation of many other crops.  Millet is self-pollinating, has a short lifecycle, is small in stature, and has a small genome size; all of these useful attributes make it an invaluable functional genomics model system, and an excellent reference genome to aid in the sequencing of other larger grasses genomes.",267371520,ftp://parrot.genomics.cn/gigadb/pub/10.5524/100001_101000/100020/,Published,GigaDBUploadForm_Millet.xls,6439431f9bbffcabbf525ba982ed6896,2011-11-12,,1,,,,,

The 18 samples represent 6 biological cohorts: 6 samples were derived from mouse embryonic stem cells (3 <em>Tdg+/-</em>, 3 <em>Tdg-/-</em>), 6 samples were from mouse neural precursor cells (3 <em>Tdg+/-</em>, 3 <em>Tdg-/-</em>) and 6 samples were obtained from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (3 <em>Tdg+/+</em>, 3 <em>Tdg-/-</em>).
Next generation sequencing was performed on the libraries using an Illumina GAIIx for each sample. Paired end alignment against the mouse genome (Build NCBIM37) was performed using BWA (v0.5.8), and filtering to remove those reads failing to map was performed using SAMtools (v0.1.9) and a custom perl script. The Bioconductor (v2.7) package MeDIPs (v1.0.0) was used to normalize for size of the sequence library, done by calculating reads per million in tiled windows across the genome. Fragment length normalization was performed using a custom perl script. Wig tracks representing library size normalized alignment were generated using a combination of MEDIPS and custom R scripts. In addition to the total alignment wig track, strand specific wig tracks were also generated, enabling the user to infer whether the MeDIP signal is derived by methylation on the forward and/or reverse strand.
The MeDIP-seq data were processed using the analysis pipeline MeDUSA (Methylated DNA Utility for Sequence Analysis). MeDUSA brings together numerous software packages to perform a full analysis of MeDIP-seq data, including sequence alignment, quality control, and determination and annotation of differentially methylated regions.",89120571392,ftp://climb.genomics.cn/pub/10.5524/100001_101000/100035/,Published,GigaDBUploadForm_MouseMethylomes.xls,3742e47510b0905f5ada8f2a63ed1946,2012-06-27,,1,,,,,

144,163,147,100094,Data and software to accompany the paper: Applying compressed sensing to genome-wide association studies.,"The aim of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) is to isolate DNA markers for variants affecting phenotypes of interest. Linear regression is employed for this purpose, and in recent years a signal-processing paradigm known as compressed sensing (CS) has coalesced around a particular class of regression techniques. CS is not a method in its own right, but rather a body of theory regarding signal recovery when the number of predictor variables (i.e., genotyped markers) exceeds the sample size. The paper shows the applicability of compressed sensing (CS) theory to genome-wide association studies (GWAS), where the purpose is to ﬁnd trait-associated tagging markers (genetic variants). Analysis scripts are contained in the compressed CS file. Mock data and scripts are found in the compressed GD file. The example scripts found in the CS repository require the GD files to be unpacked in a separate folder.

319,339,332,100245,Three Bauhinia species transcriptome sequence data,"Hong Kong’s emblem is the beautiful Bauhinia flower and appears on our flag. This is the flower of the orchid tree Bauhinia blakeana, which was first discovered in Hong Kong. What many people may not know is that it is a sterile hybrid, and how and why it ended up in Hong Kong is shrouded in mystery. <br> One of the best ways to help uncover the secrets of any organism is by understanding its genetic makeup. Genomics, sequencing of the genetic code of organisms, provides a complete look into the genetic complement of any species. It is also one of the key technologies that will define the 21st century. While Hong Kong has made major advances in this field, the general public has a very poor awareness and understanding of what this field even is. <br> By bringing together the emblematic and mysterious Bauhinia flower and the power and knowledge of genome technology, we can build a bridge between science and community— enlightening our understanding of this plant’s interesting biology and informing and educating the public about this exciting and rapidly advancing field. <br> To build such a collaborative endeavor, we are launching the Hong Kong genome project through which we will sequence the genome of the Hong Kong emblem to better understand where it came from; train local students to assemble and analyse the data — crucial skills needed for this field to advance; and engage the public through local pride. <br> This will be the first Hong Kong genome project: funded by the public; sequenced in Hong Kong; assembled and analysed by local students; and directly shared with the public. We also welcome contributions and interest from the rest of the world, hoping this serves as a model to inspire and inform other national genome projects, and aid the development of crucial genomic literacy and skills across the globe, inspiring and training a new generation of scientists to use these tools to tackle the biggest threats to mankind: climate change, disease, and food security.<br>The data presented here are four transcriptome datasets: leaf and flower data from Bauhinia blakeana as well as leaf transcriptomes from the most likely parent species Bauhinia purpurea and Bauhinia variegata.

A fast trimming algorithm is in demand to remove adapters precisely, especially in read tails with relatively low quality. <br>We present a trimming program named Atria. Atria matches the adapters in paired reads and finds possible overlapped regions with a super-fast and carefully designed byte-based matching algorithm (<i>O(n)</i> time with <i>O(1)</i> space). Atria also implements multi-threading in both sequence processing and file compression and supports single-end reads. <br>Atria performs favorably in various trimming and runtime benchmarks of both simulated and real data with other cutting-edge trimmers.

We aim to explore the temporal colonization of the gut microbiome and the benefits of early microbial intervention in newborn calves. We evaluated the impact of microbiota transplantation (MT) on metabolism and later milk production performance. <br>We followed 36 newborn calves for two months and found that the composition and ecological interactions of their gut microbiomes likely reached maturity one month after birth. Temporal changes in the gut microbiome of newborn calves are widely associated with changes in their physiological statuses, such as growth and fiber digestion. Importantly, we observed that MT reshapes the gut microbiome of newborns by altering the abundance and interaction of <i>Bacteroides</i> species, as well as amino acid pathways, such as arginine biosynthesis. Two-year follow-up of those calves further showed that MT improves their later milk production. Notably, MT improves fiber digestion, antioxidant capacity of newborns while reducing diarrhea. MT also contributes to significant changes in the metabolomic landscape, and with putative causal mediation analysis, we suggest that altered gut microbial composition in newborns may influence physiological status through microbial-derived metabolites. <br>Our study provides metagenomic and metabolomic atlas of the temporal development of the gut microbiome in newborn calves.
