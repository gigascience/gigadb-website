8,8,8,100006,Genomic data from Adelie penguin (<em>Pygoscelis adeliae</em>). ,"The Adelie penguin (<em>Pygoscelis adeliae</em>) is an iconic penguin of moderate stature and a tuxedo of black and white feathers.  The penguins are only found in the Antarctic region and surrounding islands.  Being very sensitive to climate change, and due to changes in their behavior based on minor shifts in climate, they are often used as a barometer of the Antarctic.
<br>
With its status as one of the adorable and cuddly flightless birds of Antarctica, they serve as an example for conservation, and as a result they are now categorised at low risk for endangerment.  The sequence of the penguin can be of use in understanding the genetic underpinnings of its evolutionary traits and adaptation to its extreme environment; its unique system of feathers; its prowess as a diver; and its sensitivity to climate change.  We hope that this genome data will further our understanding of one of the most remarkable creatures to waddle the planet Earth.<br> We sequenced the genome of an adult male from Inexpressible Island, Ross Sea, Antartica (provided by David Lambert) to a depth of approximately 60X with short reads from a series of libraries with various insert sizes (200bp- 20kb). 
The assembled scaffolds of high quality sequences total 1.23 Gb, with the contig and scaffold N50 values of 19 kb and 5 mb respectively. We identified 15,270 protein-coding genes with a mean length of  21.3 kb.

22,14,22,100020,Genome data from foxtail millet (<em>Setaria italica</em>).,"Foxtail millet (<em>Setaria italica</em>) (2n=18), is an annual grass grown both as cereal crop (grain production) and as forage food.  It is primarily grown in temperate, subtropical and tropical areas.  With approximately 6,000 varieties, millet is one member of the Panicoideae (grasses subfamily), which includes maize (<em>Zea mays</em>), sorghum (<em>Sorghum bicolor</em>), and sugar cane (<em>Saccharum officinarum</em>).  It is a nutritious dietary staple, containing starch, proteins, and a number of vitamins and minerals, such as calcium, iron, and sodium.  It feeds nearly one-third of the world population with main daily-calories intake, and is especially prevalent in dry climates or soil-poor regions that are not suited for the cultivation of many other crops.  Millet is self-pollinating, has a short lifecycle, is small in stature, and has a small genome size; all of these useful attributes make it an invaluable functional genomics model system, and an excellent reference genome to aid in the sequencing of other larger grasses genomes.",267371520,ftp://parrot.genomics.cn/gigadb/pub/10.5524/100001_101000/100020/,Published,GigaDBUploadForm_Millet.xls,6439431f9bbffcabbf525ba982ed6896,2011-11-12,,1,,,,,
144,163,147,100094,Data and software to accompany the paper: Applying compressed sensing to genome-wide association studies.,"The aim of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) is to isolate DNA markers for variants affecting phenotypes of interest. Linear regression is employed for this purpose, and in recent years a signal-processing paradigm known as compressed sensing (CS) has coalesced around a particular class of regression techniques. CS is not a method in its own right, but rather a body of theory regarding signal recovery when the number of predictor variables (i.e., genotyped markers) exceeds the sample size. The paper shows the applicability of compressed sensing (CS) theory to genome-wide association studies (GWAS), where the purpose is to Ô¨Ånd trait-associated tagging markers (genetic variants). Analysis scripts are contained in the compressed CS file. Mock data and scripts are found in the compressed GD file. The example scripts found in the CS repository require the GD files to be unpacked in a separate folder. Please look at accompanying readme pdfs for both repositories and annotations in the example scripts before using.",171860992,ftp://parrot.genomics.cn/gigadb/pub/10.5524/100001_101000/100094,Published,,,2014-06-06,,1,AWLGPriZKd41XEaS,,,,
200,336,212,100142,"Supporting scripts and data for ""Investigation into the annotation of protocol sequencing steps in the Sequence Read Archive"".","The workflow for the production of high-throughput sequencing data from nucleic acid samples is complex. There are a series of protocol steps to be followed in the preparation of samples for next-generation sequencing.  The quantification of bias in a number of protocol steps, namely DNA fractionation, blunting, phosphorylation, adapter ligation and library enrichment, remains to be determined. 
We examined the experimental metadata of the public repository Sequence Read Archive (SRA) in order to ascertain the level of annotation of important sequencing steps in submissions to the database.
