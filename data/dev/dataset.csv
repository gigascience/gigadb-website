27,8,27,100008,Genomic data from the polar bear (<em>Ursus maritimus</em>).,"The polar bear (<em>Ursus maritimus</em>) is one of the largest land carnivores, second only to the Alaskan brown bear.  In an effort to adapt to the extremely cold Arctic environment, it has evolved many unique characteristics.  However, ecological pressures pose a grave threat to the survival of polar bears.  The polar bear genome provides significant contributions to research concerning evolution, biodiversity and climate change.

In 2010, the BGI completed the first draft of the genome sequence of a 25 years old male polar bear.  Using next-generation sequencing technology (Illumina GA) to obtain about 101-fold genome coverage, and SOAPdenovo, the self-developed short reads assembly method, a high quality draft genome sequence was assembled with an N50 scaffold size of 15.9 megabases (Mb), and function elements annotation was finished.  A reference gene set that contained around 21,000 genes for the polar bear was predicted.  The transposable elements comprised approximately 37% of the polar bear genome.<br> The data also includes genome and SNP annotations, with SNP information from 18 polar bear and 10 brown bear individuals sampled from Greenland and Alaska.",1534646272,ftp://parrot.genomics.cn/gigadb/pub/10.5524/100001_101000/100008/,Published,GigaDBUploadForm_PolarBear.xls,113a6a83b2fd8e13c00fc466e86c0c64,2011-07-06,2014-04-22,1,,,,,
41,23,38,100044,Software and supporting material for “SOAPdenovo2: An empirically improved memory-efficient short read <em>de novo</em> assembly”,"SOAPdenovo2 is the latest <em>de novo</em> genome assembly package from BGI’s SOAP (short oligonucleotide analysis package) suite of tools (homepage here: <a href=""http://soap.genomics.org.cn/"">http://soap.genomics.org.cn/</a>). Compared to SOAPdenovo1, this new version has the advantage of a new algorithm design that reduces memory consumption in graph construction, resolves more repeat regions in contig assembly, increases coverage and length in scaffold construction, improves gap closure, and is optimized for large genomes.<br> Using new sequencing data from the YH (<em>Homo sapiens</em>) diploid genome – the first sequenced Han Chinese individual, an updated assembly was produced (see dataset here: <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.5524/100038"">doi:10.5524/100038</a>), with the N50 scores for the contig and scaffold being 3-fold and 50-fold longer, respectively, than the first published version. The genome coverage increased from 81.16% to 93.91%, and memory consumption was ~2/3 times lower during the point of largest memory consumption. <br> Benchmarking with Assemblathon1 and GAGE datasets shows that SOAPdenovo2 greatly surpasses its predecessor SOAPdenovo1 and is competitive to other assemblers on both assembly length and accuracy.
