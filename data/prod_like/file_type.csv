1,Readme,A text document describing the data/files available from the GigaDB FTP server for this dataset.,
4,Coding sequence,Predcited protein-coding regions (CDS or exon) or open reading frames in nucleotide sequences.,operation_0436
5,Protein sequence,"One or more protein sequences, possibly with associated annotation. Usually translations of coding region predictions.",data_2976
6,Annotation,"This Is a broad concept and covers all files containing annotation of something, this could be sequence features, or image features or many other things. If possible a more specific type should be used.",none
7,Other,to be used when no appropriate file type is available,none
9,Genome sequence,"nucleotide sequence file, these could be filtered or raw, but usually GigaDB only hosts processed sequence files, the raw should be deposited in the SRA",data_2977
12,ISA-Tab,Files generated by the ISA-tools,
13,Software,"a file that is executable in some way, this includes files that are integral parts of other executable files (i.e. all files in a software package are included in this type.)",
14,Alignments,"An alignment of molecular sequences, structures or profiles derived from them.",data_1916
20,Mass Spectrometry data,Data concerning a mass spectrometry measurement.,data_2536
25,Text,free text,data_3671
41,Image,"Biological or biomedical data has been rendered into an image, typically for display on screen.",data_2968
57,HTML,"a Hypertext Markup Language file, usually linking other GigaDB files together in a human readable/navigatable format",format_2331
61,Galaxy workflow,the workflow file generated by Galaxy tools,
73,Repeat sequence,This includes long terminal repeats (LTRs); sequences (typically retroviral) directly repeated at both ends of a defined sequence and other types of repeating unit. Repetitive elements within a nucleic acid sequence.,topic_3126
107,Amplicon sequence,"sequence of a particular amplicon, usually a marker gene, from one or more samples or microbiomes",
113,Script,"includes text files of command lines used to run software applications, as well as more complex scripts such as R, perl and python scripts.",
125,Mixed archive,a compressed file containing a collection of data files of mixed types,none
126,GitHub archive,a compressed file containing all the files available from a particular GitHub repo on a particular date (usually taken at the time of review of the associated manuscript),
128,Structural variation,"Variation in chromosome structure including microscopic and submicroscopic types of variation such as deletions, duplications, copy-number variants, insertions, inversions and translocations.",topic_3175
129,Sequence variants,Data on gene sequence variations resulting large-scale genotyping and DNA sequencing projects.,data_3498
130,Phylogenetic tree,"The raw data (not just an image) from which a phylogenetic tree is directly generated or plotted, such as topology, lengths (in time or in expected amounts of variance) and a confidence interval for each length.",data_0872
131,Tabular data,Tabular data represented as tab-separated values in a text file.,format_3475
132,Sequence assembly,"An assembly of fragments of a (typically genomic) DNA sequence. Typically, an assembly is a collection of contigs (for example ESTs and genomic DNA fragments) that are ordered, aligned and merged. Annotation of the assembled sequence might be included.",data_0925
133,External link,"a URL link to an external resource, this could be the actual location stored in GigaDB, or the URL(s) pasted into a text document and hosted in GigaDB.",data_1052

272,local field potential data,"Local field potentials (LFP) are transient electrical signals generated in nervous and other tissues by the summed and synchronous electrical activity of the individual cells (e.g. neurons) in that tissue. LFP are ""extracellular"" signals, meaning that they are generated by transient imbalances in ion concentrations in the spaces outside the cells, that result from cellular electrical activity.",
273,intermediary data,data that has been generated as output from one step primarily as the input for additional steps in a workflow.,
