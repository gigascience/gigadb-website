Speculation in the literature exists that these climate conditions were associated with the 2015/2016 El Niño event and/or climate change but to date no quantitative assessment has been made. Analysis of related flaviviruses -such as dengue and chikungunya, which are transmitted by the same vectors- suggests that ZIKV dynamics is sensitive to climate seasonality and longer-term variability and trends. A better understanding the climate conditions conducive to the 2014-2016 epidemic may permit the development of climate-informed short- and long-term strategies for ZIKV prevention and control.<br>Using a novel timescale-decomposition methodology, we demonstrate that extreme climate anomalies observed in most parts of South America during the current epidemic are not caused exclusively by El Niño or climate change -as speculated-, but are the result of a particular combination of climate signals acting at multiple timescales. In Brazil, the heart of the epidemic, we find that dry conditions present during 2013-2015 are explained primarily by year-to-year variability superimposed on decadal variability, but with little contribution of long-term trends. In contrast, the extreme warm temperatures of 2014-2015 resulted from the compound effect of climate change, decadal and year-to-year climate variability.<br>Here we provide the data upon which we based our interpretations.

The influence of such circadian regulation over whole-canopy fluxes remains uncertain and diurnal CO2 and H2O vapor flux dynamics in the field are currently interpreted as resulting almost exclusively from direct physiological responses to variations in light, temperature and other environmental factors. We tested whether circadian regulation would affect plant and canopy gas exchange at the Montpellier European CNRS Ecotron. Canopy and leaf level fluxes were constantly monitored under field-like environmental conditions, and under constant environmental conditions (no variation in temperature, radiation or other environmental cues).<br>
We show direct experimental evidence at canopy scales of circadian regulation of daytime gas exchange: 20-79% of the daily variation range in CO2 and H2O fluxes occurred under circadian entrainment in canopies of an annual herb (bean) and of a perennial shrub (cotton). We also observed that considering circadian regulation improved performance by 8-17% in commonly used stomatal conductance models.<br> 
Our results show that circadian controls affect diurnal patterns of CO2 and H2O fluxes in entire canopies in field-like conditions and its consideration significantly improves model performance. Circadian controls act as a “memory” of the past conditions experienced by the plant that synchronizes metabolism across entire plant canopies.<br>

In this study, an untargeted lipidomics approach was used to study the lipid profiles in psoriasis and identify lipid metabolite signatures for psoriasis through ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. Plasma samples from 90 participants (45 healthy and 45 psoriasis patients) were collected and detected. Statistical analysis was applied to find different features between the two subjects. In addition, ELISA was performed to examine differential expression lipids in psoriatic patient plasma.

Predicting how water quality will respond to global changes not only requires water quality data, but also information about the ecological context of individual water bodies across broad spatial extents. Because lake water quality is usually sampled in limited geographic regions, often for limited time periods, assessing the environmental controls of water quality requires compilation of many datasets across broad regions and across time into an integrated database. LAGOS-NE accomplishes this goal for lakes in the northeastern-most 17 U.S. states. 
<br>
LAGOS-NE contains data for 51,101 lakes and reservoirs larger than 4 ha in 17 lake-rich U.S. states. The database includes three data modules for: lake location and physical characteristics for all lakes; ecological context (i.e., the land use, geologic, climatic, and hydrologic setting of lakes) for all lakes; and in situ measurements of lake water quality for a subset of the lakes from the past three decades for approximately 2,600-12,000 lakes depending on the variable. The database contains over 200,000 measures of chlorophyll concentration and almost 900,000 measures of Secchi depth.  The water quality data were compiled from 87 lake water quality datasets from federal, state, tribal, and non-profit agencies, university researchers, and citizen scientists. 

<br>
This database is one of the largest and most comprehensive databases of its type because it includes both in situ measurements and ecological context data. Because ecological context can be used to study a variety of other questions about lakes, streams, and wetlands, this database can also be used as the foundation for other studies of freshwaters at broad spatial and ecological scales.

We present a co-designed lab workflow and bioinformatic pipeline to mitigate the two most important risks of e/iDNA: sample contamination and taxonomic mis-assignment. These risks arise from the need for amplification to detect the trace amounts of DNA and the necessity of using short target regions due to DNA degradation. Here we present a high-throughput laboratory workflow that minimises these risks via a three-step strategy: (1) each sample is sequenced for two PCR replicates from each of two extraction replicates; (2) we use a ‘twin-tagging,’ two-step PCR protocol; (3) and a multi-marker approach targeting three mitochondrial loci: 12S, 16S and CytB.

This mass of genotyping data poses several computational challenges in terms of storage, search, sharing, analysis and visualization. While existing tools try to solve these challenges, few of them offer a comprehensive and scalable solution.<br> Gigwa v2 is an easy to use, species-agnostic web application for managing and exploring high density genotyping data. It can handle multiple databases and may be installed on a local computer or deployed as an online data portal. It supports various standard import and export formats, provides advanced filtering options, and offers means to visualize density charts or push selected data into various standalone or online tools. It implements two standard RESTful APIs, GA4GH, which is healthoriented, and BrAPI, which is breeding-oriented, thus offering wide possibilities of interaction with third party applications.

Machine learning models used to screen for patients at risk of progression to dementia should therefore favor specificity (detecting only progressors) over sensitivity (detecting all progressors), especially when the prevalence of progressors is low. Here, we explore whether such high-risk patients can be identified using cognitive assessments and structural neuroimaging, by training machine learning tools in a high specificity regime. A multimodal signature of Alzheimer's dementia was first extracted from ADNI1. We then validated the predictive value of this signature on ADNI1 patients with mild cognitive impairment (N=235). The signature was optimized to predict progression to dementia over three years with low sensitivity (55.1%) but high specificity (95.6%), resulting in only moderate accuracy (69.3%) but high positive predictive value (80.4%, adjusted for a ""typical"" 33% prevalence rate of true progressors). These results were replicated in ADNI2 (N=235), with 87.8% adjusted positive predictive value (96.7% specificity, 47.3% sensitivity, 85.1% accuracy). We found that cognitive measures alone could identify high-risk individuals, with structural measurements providing a slight improvement. The signature had comparable receiver operating characteristics to standard machine learning tools, yet a marked improvement in positive predictive value was achieved over the literature by selecting a high specificity operating point.

For this reason, the Common Workflow Language (CWL) was recently introduced as a specification for platform-independent workflow description, and work began to transition existing pipelines and workflow managers to CWL.

However, in the field these stresses usually occur together because reduced transpirational cooling under drought conditions results in increased plant tissue temperature. In addition, environmental stresses are usually transient and the ability to efficiently recover from stress may be at least as important for overall stress tolerance as the direct stress response itself. Nevertheless, nothing is known about recovery mechanisms after drought and heat stress in rice under field conditions. <br>We have used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomics to elucidate the metabolic responses of flag leaves, flowering spikelets and developing seeds from three rice cultivars differing in their drought and heat tolerance to rewatering after stress in the field. Within 60 h after rewatering, many stressresponsive metabolites returned to their control levels, although recovery was not complete. In addition, control plants showed developmental differences that were revealed by metabolite profiles during 60 h of post-stress sampling, in particular in developing seeds. Correlation analysis identified several metabolites as marker candidates for the stability of grain yield or quality under conditions of combined drought and heat stress. <br> The rewatering responses of stressed plants seemed to be a combination of the reversal of stress effects and reinitiation of development after stress relief.

While it is practical to simplify these networks by placing constraints on compartments and hubs, it is unclear how these simplifications alter the structure of metabolic networks and the interpretation of metabolomic experiments. We curated and adapted the latest systemic model of human metabolism and developed customizable tools to define metabolic networks with and without compartmentalization in subcellular organelles and with or without inclusion of prolific metabolite hubs. Compartmentalization made networks larger, less dense, and more modular; whereas hubs made networks larger, more dense, and less modular. When present, these hubs also dominated shortest paths in the network, yet their exclusion exposed the subtler prominence of other metabolites that are typically more relevant to metabolomic experiments. We applied the non-compartmental network without metabolite hubs in a retrospective, exploratory analysis of metabolomic measurements from five studies on human tissues. Network clusters identified individual reactions that might experience differential regulation between experimental conditions, several of which were not apparent in the original publications. Exclusion of specific metabolite hubs exposes modularity in both compartmental and non-compartmental metabolic networks, improving detection of relevant clusters in ""-omic"" measurements.

Here we present a high-quality genome assembly of the bat hawkmoth Hyles vespertilio, the first reference genome of a member of the Hyles genus. We generated 51X PacBio long reads with an average read length of 8.9 kb.

The circular mitochondrial contig has a length of 15,303 bases. The H. vespertilio genome is very repeat-rich and exhibits a higher repeat content (50.3%) than other Bombycoidea species such as Bombyx mori (45.7%) and Manduca sexta (27.5%).

While it promises unparalleled insights into the genetic content of the biological samples studied, conclusions drawn are at risk from biases inherent to the DNA sequencing methods, including inaccurate abundance estimates as a function of genomic GC contents. We explored such GC-biases across many commonly used platforms in experiments sequencing multiple genomes (with mean GC contents ranging from 28.9% to 62.4%) and metagenomes. GC-bias profiles varied among different library preparation protocols and sequencing platforms. We found that our workflows employing MiSeq and NextSeq suffered major GC-biases, with problems becoming increasingly severe outside the 45-65% GC range, leading to a falsely low coverage in GC-rich and especially GC-poor sequences, where genomic windows with 30% GC content had over 10-fold less coverage than windows close to 50% GC content. We also showed that GC content correlates very tightly with coverage biases. The PacBio and HiSeq platforms also evidenced similar profiles of GC-biases to each other which were distinct from those seen in the MiSeq and NextSeq workflows. The Oxford Nanopore workflow was not afflicted with GC-bias. These findings indicate potential sources of difficulty, arising from GC-biases, in genome sequencing which could be pre-emptively addressed with methodological optimisations provided that the GC-biases inherent to the relevant workflow are understood. Furthermore, it is recommended that a more critical approach is taken in quantitative abundance estimates in metagenomic studies.
