3088,1838,"Description updated from : Advances in large scale tumor sequencing have lead to an understanding that there are combinations of genomic and transcriptomic alterations specific to tumor types, shared across many patients. Unfortunately, computational identi¬cation of functionally meaningful and recurrent alteration patterns within gene/protein interaction networks has proven to be challenging. We introduce a novel combinatorial method, cd-CAP, for simultaneous detection of connected subnetworks of an interaction network where genes exhibit conserved alteration patterns across tumor samples. Our method differentiates distinct alteration types associated with each gene (rather than relying on binary information of a gene being altered or not), and simultaneously detects multiple alteration profile conserved subnetworks. In a number of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data sets, cd-CAP identi¬fied large biologically signi¬cant subnetworks with conserved alteration patterns, shared across many tumor samples.",2019-02-13 17:37:38.938839,dataset,1838,""

4766,373,"Description updated from : The relationship between dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been extensively reported, but the global lipid profiles, especially in the East Asia population, associated with the development of T2D remain to be characterized.
Liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was applied to detect the global lipidome in fasting plasma of 293 Chinese individuals, including 114 T2D patients, 81 prediabetic subjects and 98 individuals with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Both qualitative and quantitative analyses revealed a gradual change in plasma lipid features going from NGT individuals over prediabetic to T2D individuals with T2D patients exhibiting characteristics close to those in prediabetic individuals, whereas they differed significantly from individuals with NGT. We constructed and validated a random forest (RF) classifier with 28 lipidomic features that effectively discriminated T2D from NGT or prediabetes. The majority of the selected features showed significant correlations with diabetic clinical indices.
Hydroxybutyrylcarnitine was positively correlated with fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour postprandial glucose (2h-PG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), and lysophosphatidylcholines such as LysoPC (18:0), LysoPC (18:1) and LysoPC (18:2) were all negatively correlated with HOMA-IR.

4772,304,"Description updated from : The emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) as a public health emergency in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) occurred during a period of severe drought and unusually high temperatures. Speculation in the literature exists that these climate conditions were associated with the 2015/2016 El Niño event and/or climate change but to date no quantitative assessment has been made. Analysis of related flaviviruses -such as dengue and chikungunya, which are transmitted by the same vectors- suggests that ZIKV dynamics is sensitive to climate seasonality and longer-term variability and trends. A better understanding the climate conditions conducive to the 2014-2016 epidemic may permit the development of climate-informed short- and long-term strategies for ZIKV prevention and control.<br>
Using a novel timescale-decomposition methodology, we demonstrate that extreme climate anomalies observed in most parts of South America during the current epidemic are not caused exclusively by El Niño or climate change -as speculated-, but are the result of a particular combination of climate signals acting at multiple timescales. In Brazil, the heart of the epidemic, we find that dry conditions present during 2013-2015 are explained primarily by year-to-year variability superimposed on decadal variability, but with little contribution of long-term trends. In contrast, the extreme warm temperatures of 2014-2015 resulted from the compound effect of climate change, decadal and year-to-year climate variability.<br>
Here we provide the data upon which we based our interpretations. As described in the manuscript these have been aquired from the full data, which are available at http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/maproom/Health/index.html and http://datoteca.ole2.org/maproom/Sala_de_Salud-Clima/index.html.es <br>",2019-08-16 13:23:24.064941,dataset,304,""
4774,369,"Description updated from : Most investigators of brain computer interface (BCI) believe that BCI can be achieved through induced neuronal activity from the cortex, but not by evoked neuronal activity. Motor imagery (MI) based BCI is one of the standard concepts of BCI, in that the user can generate induced activity by imagining motor movements. However, variations in performance over sessions and subjects are too severe to overcome easily; therefore, a basic understanding and investigation of BCI performance variation is necessary to find critical evidence of performance variation.<br>
Here we present not only EEG datasets for MI BCI from 52 subjects, but also the results of a psychological and physiological questionnaire, EMG datasets, the locations of 3D EEG electrodes, and EEGs for non-task related states. <br>
We validated our EEG datasets by using the percentage of bad trials, event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) analysis, and classification analysis. After conventional rejection of bad trials, we showed contralateral ERD and ipsilateral ERS in the somatosensory area, which are well-known patterns of MI. Finally, we showed that 73.08% of datasets (38 subjects) included reasonably discriminative information.<br>
Our EEG datasets included information necessary to determine statistical significance; they consisted of well-discriminated datasets (38 subjects) and less-discriminative datasets. These may provide researchers with opportunities to investigate human factors related to MI BCI performance variation, and may also achieve subject-to-subject transfer by using metadata, including a questionnaire, EEG coordinates, and EEGs for non-task related states. <br>
