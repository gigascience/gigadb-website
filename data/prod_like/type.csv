1,Epigenomic,"Epigenetics the study of the chemical modification of specific genes or gene-associated proteins of an organism  (e.g. methylation and histone modification). Includes Epigenomics - The study of the epigenetic modifications of a whole cell, tissue, organism etc.; http://edamontology.org/topic_3295"
2,Genomic,"The branch of biology that deals with heredity, especially the mechanisms of hereditary transmission and the variation of inherited characteristics among similar or related organisms. Includes Genomics - The study of comprehensive sets of genes via high throughput methods.e.g.  sequence analysis and assemblies; http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C16624 "
3,Metagenomic,genetic and genomic data from environmental samples
4,Transcriptomic,"The analysis of transcriptomes, or a set of all the RNA molecules in a specific organism, tissue, cell etc.; http://edamontology.org/topic_3308"
5,Workflow,The sequence of steps involved in moving from the beginning to the end of a biological or biomedical analytical workflow or pipeline; http://edamontology.org/topic_0769
6,Software,"The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of computer software, e.g. computational tools for analysing and managing biological data; http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C17147"
7,Imaging,"The visual representation of an object. This includes diffraction experiments that are based upon the interference of waves, typically electromagnetic waves such as X-rays or visible light, by some object being studied, typical in order to produce an image of the object or determine its structure;  http://edamontology.org/topic_3382"
8,Metabolomic,""
10,Proteomic,"The global analysis of cellular proteins. Proteomics uses a combination of sophisticated techniques including two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis, image analysis, mass spectrometry, amino acid sequencing, and bio-informatics to resolve comprehensively, to quantify, and to characterize proteins; http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C20085"
