# Giga Review Guide

## Getting started

Go to the gigareview directory then start the gigareview application
```
$ cd gigareview
$ ./up.sh

```
>**Note**: In the rest of this doc, we assume we are in the ``gigareview`` directory

## Operating GigaReview

Fetch latest EM reports from SFTP server:
```
$ docker-compose run --rm console ./yii fetch-reports/fetch
```

Process jobs in manuscript queue:
```
$ docker-compose run --rm console ./yii manuscripts-q/run
```

Go to http://gigadb.gigasciencejournal.com:9170/gigareview/index.php?r=manuscript.
If there were manuscripts that have been accepted for publication during the
previous day then these will be displayed on the Manuscripts page.

## Run the tests

```
$ ./tests/unit_runner
$ ./tests/functional_runner
$ ./tests/acceptance_runner

```
## Review or change configuration of the application

The source of configuration file (examples and templates) are in ``config-sources``
The Yii2 advanced template expects to find the source for each environment in the ``environments`` directory.

``generate_config.sh`` and ``init`` are the scripts to look into to understand how the application is configured. 
The former will interpolate variables from Gitlab with placeholders in template file and generate the configuration in the ``environments`` directory.
The latter will copy the files in the selected environment subdirectory from ``environments`` directory into the configuration directory of each sub-applications 

## Local deployment

The Gigareview system is instantiated using Docker compose services, as defined in ``docker-compose.yml``
and orchestrated in ``up.sh``

As prerequisite, ensure the following variables are defined in Gitlab at project level

| Key | Value    | Masked | Environments |
| --- |----------|--------|--------------|
| REVIEW_DB_DATABASE | reviewdb | no     | dev|
| REVIEW_DB_HOST | reviewdb | no     | dev|
| REVIEW_DB_PASSWORD | reviewdb | yes    | dev|
| REVIEW_DB_PORT | 5432     | no | dev|
| REVIEW_DB_USERNAME | reviewdb | no | dev|


## Remote Deployment

At the moment, the app is deployed using the Ansible playbook ``ops/infrastructure/bastion_playbook.yml``

As prerequisite, ensure the following variables are defined in Gitlab at project level:

| Key | Value            | Masked  | Environments |
| --- |------------------|---------|--------------|
| REVIEW_DB_DATABASE | reviewdb         | no      | staging      |
| REVIEW_DB_HOST | reviewdb         | no      | staging      |
| REVIEW_DB_PASSWORD | (choose a value) | yes     | staging      |
| REVIEW_DB_PORT | 5432             | no      | staging      |
| REVIEW_DB_USERNAME | reviewdb         | no      | staging      |
| REVIEW_DB_DATABASE | reviewdb         | staging | live         |
| REVIEW_DB_HOST | reviewdb         | no      | live         |
| REVIEW_DB_PASSWORD | (choose a value) | yes     | live         |
| REVIEW_DB_PORT | 5432             | no      | live         |
| REVIEW_DB_USERNAME | reviewdb         | no      | live         |


## Other important variables

Developers typically don't have to set those as they are not specific to a fork, 
but they are needed by the Gigareview application.

They should already bet set on the Gigascience's Forks subgroup and on Upstream's gigadb-website project.

 Key               | Value    | Masked | Environments |
|-------------------|----------|--------|--------------|
| POSTGRES_DB       | postgres | no     | All          |
| POSTGRES_USER     | postgres | no     | All          |
| POSTGRES_PASSWORD | *******  | yes    | All          |

Additionally, the variable POSTGRES_MAJOR_VERSION is also in use,
but it hard-coded in the ``gitlab-config.yml`` file,
so there is no need for it to be in Gitlab variables.

# More detailed information (not necessary to get started)

## How was the project bootstrapped (for info only)

1. Create project structure
```
$ docker-compose run --rm test composer create-project --prefer-dist yiisoft/yii2-app-advanced gigareview
```

2. Update ``docker-compose.yml``

3. Update ``Dockerfile`` for each module

4. create ``env-sample``

5. Ensure canonical location for configuration files remains the ``environments`` directory

6. Ensure shared configuration is created in the ``common`` sub-directory of the above directory

7. Update ``.gitignore`` to reflect the configuration strategy

## how were the tables and ActiveRecord classes created (for info only)

Example of Ingest business object for managing EM ingest workflow:

Creating the database migration for the table:
```
$ docker-compose run --rm console ./yii migrate/create create_ingest_table --fields="file_name:string,report_type:integer,fetch_status:smallinteger,parse_status:smallinteger,store_status:smallinteger,remote_file_status:smallinteger,created_at:biginteger, updated_at:biginteger"
```

Creating the corresponding model class
```
$ docker-compose run --rm console ./yii gii/model --ns="common\models" --tableName="ingest" --modelClass="Ingest"  
```
Create the unit test for that model class

```
$ docker-compose run --rm console ./vendor/codeception/codeception/codecept -c /app/common/codeception.yml generate:test unit Ingest
```

Create Feature file for BDD (Gherkin) style acceptance tests:

```
$ docker-compose run --rm console ./vendor/codeception/codeception/codecept -c console/codeception.yml generate:feature acceptance FetchReports
```

## Use local FTP server provided by Docker container

There is a Docker service called `sftp_test` defined in `docker-compose.yml`
which can provide a local SFTP server containing EM reports which can be 
customised for development work. To use the `sftp_test` service, replace the 
`sftp` configuration in `gigareview/common/config/params-local.php` with the 
following:
```
'sftp' => [
    "host" => "sftp_test",
    "username" => "testuser",
    "password" => "testpass",
    "baseDirectory" => "editorialmanager",
],
```

Now, execute `./up.sh` to start the GigaReview application. Running
`docker-compose run --rm console ./yii fetch-reports/fetch` will now retrieve
EM reports from the `sftp_test` SFTP server instead of the production SFTP
server. The fetched EM reports are those which are found in the 
`gigareview/console/tests/_data` directory.
