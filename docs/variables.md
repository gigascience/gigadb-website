* TLSAUTH_KEY
* STAGING_IP_ADDRESS

## File: secrets-sample

The above variables are retrieved from GitLab in a step within the `up.sh` 
script. The [secrets-sample](../ops/configuration/variables/secrets-sample) 
file provides a template listing of these variables.

# Docker environment variables

Variables used to configure the Docker environment are set in a `.env` file. A
sample of these variables can be found in [env-sample](../ops/configuration/variables/env-sample).
