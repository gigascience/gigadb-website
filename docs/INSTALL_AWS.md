# Deploying GigaDB on AWS

The GigaDB website can be deployed on an AWS EC2 instance using Vagrant.
This document outlines how this can be achieved.

## Amazon Machine Image

Launching GigaDB on AWS requires an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) which
provides the information required to launch a virtual server in the
cloud. The AMI for GigaDB contains a template for a filesystem 
consisting of the Centos 6 operating system and a number of server
applications.

The [Packer](https://www.packer.io) tool was used for creating the AMI
for GigaDB from a source configuration available from
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/pli888/vagrant-boxes) and issuing
the following commands in its root directory:

```sh
$ cd packer
$ ./build.sh
```

Packer itself uses a pre-built AMI as the source for building the GigaDB 
AMI. This process involves using an AWS account to launch an EC2 
instance from the source pre-built AMI, provisioning this running 
machine and then creating an AMI from this machine. The GigaDB AMI ID is 
ami-b85e86db.

## Preparation

An AWS user account is required to launch an EC2 instance deployed with
GigaDB. Vagrant needs to be able to access the AWS user account's 
security credentials using the following environment variables:

```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="Access key for accessing AWS"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="Secret access key for accessing AWS"
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="The region to start the instance in"
AWS_KEYPAIR_NAME="Name of keypair used to bootstrap AMIs"
AWS_SECURITY_GROUPS="Name of AWS security group to use"
AWS_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH="Path to AWS private key"
AWS_KEYPAIR_NAME="Name of keypair used to bootstrap AMIs"
```

The above environment variables can be set and managed in your
`~/.bash_profile` file. Once these additions have been made then the
.bash_profile should be sourced to load the AWS variables into your 
environment:

```bash
$ source ~/.bash_profile
```

In order for Vagrant to control and provision machines hosted on EC2
instances, the AWS provider plugin for Vagrant needs to be installed:

```bash
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-aws
```

## Deployment

To deploy GigaDB on an AWS virtual server, you need to download the 
gigadb-website GitHub source code repository with its chef-cookbooks 
submodule:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website.git
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

In addition, there are variables in GigaDB which require values to be 
set in order for the web site to function. These variables are listed in
the `gigadb-website/chef/environments/development.json.sample` file. The
values in this file should be provided and the `development.json.sample`
file renamed as `development.json`. However, your technical liaison at 
*GigaScience* will be able to provide you with a development.json file 
with example values that these variables should be configured with.

GigaDB can then be deployed onto the AWS cloud by issuing the command 
below:

```bash
$ vagrant up --provider=aws
```

If successful, the GigaDB website will be visible on a web browser
using the IP address of the EC2 instance.

## SSH access

The aws Chef recipe in the chef/site-cookbooks directory allows user
accounts to be created on your EC2 cloud server. These user accounts
are created with the user's SSH public key. Its corresponding SSH
private key will therefore allow a SSH connection without a password
being required:

```bash
$ ssh user1@ec2-xx-xxx-xxx-x.ap-southeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com
Last login: Thu Jul 21 06:30:01 2016 from xx.xxx.xxx.xxx
[user1@ip-xxx-xx-xx-xxx ~]$ ls

```

## Server security

The GigaDB AWS instance uses a number of security layers to protect the 
virtual server from network attacks. An [AWS security group](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html)
is its first firewall of protection against network attacks. If further 
configuration of the AWS security group is required, this can be done 
via the AWS web-based management console.

The GigaDB EC2 server is provisioned with [iptables](https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/Network/IPTables)
which acts as another firewall. Changes to iptables to allow connections
from other services will need to be configured within the aws Chef 
recipe.

[Fail2ban](http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) is another 
layer of protection added by the aws recipe. Fail2ban scans log files 
used by services such as nginx and bans IP addresses that show malicious
signs of attacking the server, e.g. too many login and password 
failures. These IP addresses are then blocked from connecting to the 
server by updating iptables rules. Which log files are scanned are 
configured by setting banning policies. These policies are listed in the 
aws recipe.

[SElinux](https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/SELinux) is an access control 
mechanism which has been switched on in the GigaDB EC2 server. Its 
configuration is controlled within the aws recipe.

## PostgreSQL database

The GigaDB website relies on the use of a PostgreSQL database to store
metadata relating to published datasets. This database can be accessed
using the psql command line interface. Users on the AWS virtual server
can access the gigadb database as follows:

```bash
$ ssh user1@xx.xxx.xxx.xxx
Last login: Tue Sep 20 08:02:10 2016 from xxx.xxx.xx.xxx
$ psql -U gigadb -h localhost
psql (9.1.23)
Type "help" for help.

(2 rows)

gigadb=> 

```

In addition, it is possible to use pgAdmin3 GUI as a client to manage 
the database. To create a connection the database, select Add server 
from the File menu or click on the plug icon on the pgAdmin GUI window. 
A New Server Registration box will appear in which you need to click on 
the SSH Tunnel tab. The text fields in this box need to completed as 
follows:

Next, the connection to the PostgreSQL database itself needs to be
set up:

<img src="https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website/blob/develop/images/docs/pgadmin5.png?raw=true">

`gigadb` should appear as an available database with a successful
PostgreSQL connection to the Vagrant VM:

### Database backups

Backups of GigaDB's PostgreSQL database are made nightly by a bash 
script which is executed as a cron job. These backups are stored in an 
AWS bucket, the programmatic and console access of which have been 
already provided to users using access key and password credentials.
