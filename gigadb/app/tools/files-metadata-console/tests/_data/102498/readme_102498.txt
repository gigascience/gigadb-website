[Data Summary] In addressing the evolving landscape of cell clustering
methodologies, this paper unveils a pioneering strategy leveraging the Variable
Neighborhood Search (VNS) metaheuristic. The motivation behind this exploration
lies in the need to tackle the intricate task of clustering cells based on both
gene expression and spatial coordinates. To present a comprehensive solution, we
initially cast the cell clustering challenge as an Integer Linear Programming
(ILP) minimization problem, harnessing the robust foundation of VNS. Our
proposed approach introduces a novel model based on the VNS technique,
demonstrating its efficacy in navigating the complexities inherent in cell
clustering. Notably, our method transcends the confines of conventional cell
type clustering, as evidenced by our initial results, extending its application
to spatial domain clustering. This inherent adaptability enables our algorithm
to orchestrate clusters based on information gleaned from both gene expression
matrices and spatial coordinates. Validation through rigorous testing
underscores the superior performance of our method when compared to existing
techniques chronicled in the literature. In summary, our project not only
advances the current progress of clustering methodologies but also holds immense
potential for transformative applications across diverse fields, from biomedical
research to spatial data analysis. The overall benefits of our approach
underscore its capacity to significantly impact and propel scientific
investigation forward.
