# README GENERATOR TOOL

## Preparation

In the `gigadb-website` repo root directory, spin up the GigaDB application
since we need access to the `database` container for the `gigadb` and 
`gigadb_testdata` databases.
```
$ pwd
/path/to/gigadb-website
$ ./up.sh
```

Now change directory to the `readme-generator` folder
```
$ cd gigadb/app/tools/readme-generator
```

Create a `.env` file:
```
$ cp config-sources/env.example .env
```
> Ensure you have provide values for `GITLAB_PRIVATE_TOKEN` and `REPO_NAME`
> variables.

Generate config files:
```
# Generate configuration using variables in .env, GitLab, then exit
$ docker-compose run --rm configure
```
> db.php and test_db.php should be present in the `config` directory. There 
> should be a runtime/curators directory too.

Install Composer dependencies:
```
$  docker-compose run --rm tool composer install 
```

The copying of readme files created by this tool into Wasabi requires Rclone
to be installed on your `dev` machine. This can be done using as follows:
```
# Using Homebrew
$ brew install rclome
# Or using Macports
$ sudo port install rclone
```

> There is an analogous step in the Ansible playbook for the bastion server 
> for installing Rclone on staging and live environments.
> ansible-galaxy install -r ../../../infrastructure/requirements.yml

The create readme tool uses the rclone configuration file from the wasabi
migration tool. Change directory to the `gigadb-website/gigadb/app/tools/wasabi-migration`
directory and make a copy of the `env.example` file called `.env`:
```
$ cd gigadb/app/tools/wasabi-migration
$ cp env.example .env
```

In the new `.env` file, uncomment and provide a value for the
`GITLAB_PRIVATE_TOKEN` variable.

Also provide the name of GitLab project fork in the `REPO_NAME` variable.

You should then be able to create the configuration file for rclone by
executing:
```
$ docker-compose run --rm config
```

Check if the configuration process has worked by looking for the
`config/rclone.conf` file.

## How to test

Ensure you have `bats` installed (e.g: on macOS, you could do `brew install bats-core`
or `port install bats-core`). Then run:
```
# Ensure you are in gigadb/app/tools/readme-generator directory
$ bats tests
 ✓ create readme file
 ✓ create readme file and copy to wasabi
```


## Using readme generator tool

The readme information for a dataset can be viewed on standard output using its
DOI:
```
$ docker-compose run --rm tool /app/yii readme/create --doi 100142
```

Information for the readme is retrieved from the `database` container that was
spun up using the `up.sh` command above. The tool is able to connect to this
container by connecting to the Docker `db-tier` network.

Saving the readme information into a file requires a file path, for example:
```
$ docker-compose run --rm tool /app/yii readme/create --doi=100142 --outdir=/home/curators
```
Since `/home/curators` has been mounted to `runtime/curators` directory in
`docker-compose.yml`, you should find a `readme_100142.txt` created there after
running the above command.

## Using readme generator tool via shell wrapper script 

There is a shell script which can also be used to call the readme tool:
```
$ ./createReadme.sh --doi 100142 --outdir /home/curators
```

In the absence of an output directory `outdir` parameter or if the directory
cannot be created then an error message will be displayed:
```
$ ./createReadme.sh --doi 100142 --outdir /home/foo
Cannot save readme file - Output directory does not exist or is not a directory
ERROR: 65
```

An error message is also displayed if a DOI is provided for a dataset that does 
not exist:
```
$ ./create_readme.sh --doi 1
Creating readme_tool_run ... done
Exception 'Exception' with message 'Dataset 1 not found'
```

## Using readme generator tool on Bastion server

Before running the bastion playbook, execute the following command to install
the ansible-rclone role for Ansible in your development environment:
```
$ ansible-galaxy install -r ../../../infrastructure/requirements.yml
```

Log into bastion server
```
# Get public IP address for bastion server
$ terraform output
ec2_bastion_private_ip = "10.88.8.888"
ec2_bastion_public_ip = "88.888.888.888"

# Log into bastion server
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-private-key.pem centos@88.888.888.888
```

Using docker command to access tool:
```
$ docker run --rm -v /home/centos/readmeFiles:/app/readmeFiles registry.gitlab.com/$GITLAB_PROJECT/production_tool:staging /app/yii readme/create --doi 100142 --outdir /app/readmeFiles
```

Use shell script to run readme tool:
```
$ ./createReadme.sh --doi 100142 --outdir /app/readmeFiles
```

In both cases, look in the readmeFiles directory for the readme file that has
been created by the tool.

The createReadme.sh script can also be used to copy the newly created readme 
file into the Wasabi gigadb-datasets bucket. To test this in dry-run mode,
execute:
```
$ ./createReadme.sh --doi 100142 --outdir /app/readmeFiles --wasabi
```

If you look at the latest log file in the logs directory, you will see the
destination path that the readme file will be copied to which will be in the 
staging directory. You can deactivate dry-run mode using the --apply flag:
```
$ ./createReadme.sh --doi 100142 --outdir /app/readmeFiles --wasabi --apply
```

You can confirm that the presence of the new readme file in the 100142 directory
using the Wasabi web console.

To copy the readme file to the live data directory:
```
$ ./createReadme.sh --doi 100142 --outdir /app/readmeFiles --wasabi --use-live-data --apply
```

## Tests

### Unit test

The unit test checks custom-written `getAuthors` function in Dataset model class 
which returns the authors of a dataset based on many-to-many mapping between 
dataset and author tables via a junction `dataset_authors` table:
```
$ docker-compose run --rm tool ./vendor/bin/codecept run tests/unit
```

There's also a unit test to check the ReadmeGenerator component class:
```
$ docker-compose run --rm tool ./vendor/bin/codecept run --debug tests/unit/components/ReadmeGeneratorTest.php
```

### Functional test

There is a functional test which checks the `actionCreate()` function in 
`ReadmeController`.
```
$ docker-compose run --rm tool ./vendor/bin/codecept run tests/functional

# Run single test
$ docker-compose run --rm tool ./vendor/bin/codecept run tests/functional/ReadmeCest.php
```
