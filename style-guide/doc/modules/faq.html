              <p><em>GigaDB</em> is the home for all data/files/tools/software associated with GigaScience manuscripts. <em>GigaDB</em> curators will ensure the information is complete and appropriately formatted, before cataloging and publishing. Submission of data to <em>GigaDB</em> complements but does not serve as a replacement for community approved public repositories, supporting data and source code should still be made publicly available in a suitable public repository. <em>GigaDB</em> can link any and all publicly deposited data together with additional files/tools that do not have a natural home in any other public repository. </p>
