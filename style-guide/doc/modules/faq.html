                <em>GigaDB</em>
                is the home for all data/files/tools/software associated with GigaScience manuscripts.
                <em>GigaDB</em>
                curators will ensure the information is complete and appropriately formatted, before cataloging and publishing. Submission of data to
                <em>GigaDB</em>
                complements but does not serve as a replacement for community approved public repositories, supporting data and source code should still be made publicly available in a suitable public repository.
                <em>GigaDB</em>
                can link any and all publicly deposited data together with additional files/tools that do not have a natural home in any other public repository.
