In response to this situation, and immediately after the reports of deaths, the University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf and BGI-Shenzhen worked together to sequence the bacterium and assess its human health risk.\r\n\r\nThe bacteriumâ€™s genome was first sequenced using Life Technologies; Ion Torrent sequencing platform. According to the results of the draft assembly, the estimated genome size of this new <em>E. coli</em> strain is about 5.2 Mb.  Sequence analysis indicated this bacterium is an EHEC serotype O104 <em>E. coli</em> strain.  Comparative analysis showed that this bacterium has 93% sequence similarity with the EAEC 55989 <em>E. coli</em> strain, which was isolated in the Central African Republic and known to cause serious diarrhea.  This strain of <em>E. coli</em>, however, has also acquired specific sequences that appear to be similar to those involved in the pathogenicity of hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome.  The acquisition of these genes may have occurred through horizontal gene transfer.\r\n\r\nTo maximize its utility to the research community and aid those fighting the epidemic, this genomic data was released into the public domain under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">CC0 license</a>.\r\n\r\nTo the extent possible under law, <a href ="http://www.genomics.cn/">BGI Shenzhen</a>  has waived all copyright and related or neighboring rights to genomic data from the 2011 <em>E. coli</em> outbreak.

Using second-generation Illumina GA sequencing data, the first de novo genome assembly was created using short-read sequencing technology.  Here you will find the giant panda genome sequence assembly as well as annotation information, such as gene structure and function, non-coding RNAs, and repeat elements.  Also presented are polymorphism information detected in the diploid genome, including SNPs, indels, and structural variations (SVs).  The assembly was done using SOAPdenovo software and the panda genome data is visualized via MapView, which is powered by the Google Web Toolkit.',
