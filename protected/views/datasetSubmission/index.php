            GigaDB primarily serves as a repository to host data and tools associated with articles in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/">GigaScience</a>, as well as certain <a target="_blank" href="http://www.genomics.cn/">BGI</a> data not associated with GigaScience articles. Datasets that are not affiliated with a GigaScience article are approved for inclusion by the Editors of GigaScience. Inclusion of particularly interesting, previously unpublished datasets may be considered, especially if they meet the criteria for inclusion as a Data Note article in the journal (see author instructions <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/authors/instructions/datanote">here</a>). You may send a short summary of your data to the <a href="mailto:editorial@gigasciencejournal.com">Editors</a> for review prior to submission.
            <br>
            Any and all data/files required for reproducibility of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/">GigaScience</a> manuscripts should be either hosted in, or linked-to from, a GigaDB dataset. You may provide all relevant information to create a GigaDB dataset here.
            There are further instructions to submitters <a target="_blank" href="http://gigadb.org/site/help">here</a>, as well as many useful tips in our <a target="_blank" href="http://gigadb.org/site/faq">FAQs</a> section.
