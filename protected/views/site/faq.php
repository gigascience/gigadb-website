                                    <ol>
                                        <li> use the online <a href="http://gigadb.org/dataset/upload">submission wizard</a> - this is a good option for datasets with few authors, and few files. The wizard currently does not have functionality to upload tabular information so everything must be typed in individually.</li>
                                        <li> use the template spreadsheet (excel, but compatible with open office too) downloadable from <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fgigadb.org%2Ffiles%2FGigaDBUploadForm.xls&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFrqEzf6cPyp-vGxxVTE9OEq2TPsJqU7fg">here </a>- This option is better where there are multiple authors and/or multiple files and/or samples. NB. the spreadsheet contains macros, but these are only to allow the forward and back buttons to work so can be disabled, you can just click the relevant tabs at the bottom of the spreadsheet.</li>

                                    <p>There shouldn't be, and a major rationale for data publishing is to incentivise earlier release of data in this manner. It is commonly understood throughout the publishing community that publishing data (as a Data Note or in a public archive) is a good thing to be encouraged, and as such, there are no penalties to then subsequently publishing research based on those data. <i>GigaScience</i> has published plenty of data notes and released data sets prior to the analysis papers being published, some examples are: </p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>3,000 Rice Genomes Project (13.4 Tb data).</li>
                                        <li>Polar Bear genome - dataset released in <em>GigaDB</em> nearly 3 years before the analysis paper was published in <i>Cell</i>.</li>
                                        <li>Deadly 2011 outbreak <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5524/100001" target="_blank"><i>E. Coli</i> genome</a> that lead to over 50 deaths in Germany (and eventually published in <i>NEJM</i>).</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>Our Polar bear genome data was released nearly three years before any official publication came out from the project, and despite being used by at least 5 other studies, the analysis paper made the cover of <i>Cell</i> (see <a href="http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/gigablog/2014/05/14/the-latest-weapon-in-publishing-data-the-polar-bear/" target="_blank">the blog</a> for more). </p>
                                    <p>Journals do not consider the publication of a dataset with a DOI and associated protocol information as a 'prior publication' that would preclude subsequent publication of new results obtained from such a dataset. F1000 Research did a useful survey to confirm this with a number of publishers (see: <a href="http://f1000research.com/data-policies" target="_blank"> F1000 policy</a>), and this is only going to become increasingly observed and accepted as most of the publishers are now promoting their own Data Journals.</p>

                                    <p>As early release as possible is encouraged, although the standard protocol we follow is to maintain data as private to the peer reviewers only until the associated manuscript has been formally accepted, at which point the dataset is released, this is usually several days prior to the manuscript publication due to production times of the BMC publishing system. While we cannot foresee any reason why datasets should be embargoed for extended periods we can discuss this further on a case-by-case basis.If you have major concerns about someone else publishing on your data before you, we can add a Fair Use policy statement on the <em>GigaDB</em> dataset page which looks like this:</p>

                                    <p>The term dataset in <em>GigaDB</em> refers to a collection of related works, including but not limited to; files, software, workflows, experiments, data, metadata and results. Each dataset has its own webpage which has a DOI (digital object identifier). These datasets are permanent and citable records of research output designed to allow for a modernization of the classical publishing framework while maintaining the familiarity of citations and metrics thereof.While uncommon, it is possible for a dataset to be made-up of several other datasets in a nested fashion, for example the Avian phylogenomics project data dataset (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5524/101000">http://dx.doi.org/10.5524/101000</a>) is a compilation of 48 other datasets, some of those were published before and some at the same time. This allows the original authors to cite just one dataset to cover them all, but also allows future users to cite individual datasets if they require. We will discuss the merits of such procedures on a case-by-case basis with the submitter.</p>
