                        <p>All Metabolomics and Lipomics data must be deposited in a public repository that is part of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.metabolomexchange.org">MetabolomeXchange</a> (we recommend <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights">Metabolights</a> database at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">EBI</a>), before you submit to <i>GigaScience</i> or GigaDB. </p>
                        <p>In cases where sample metadata* are not fully consented for public release, e.g. patient information, you must first submit the non-public data/metadata to the Genome-Phenome Archive (<a href="http://ega-archive.org/">EGA</a>) to enable controlled access.</p>
                        <p>*Note- we do expect the anonymised data to be made publicly available via Metabolights as this is not traceable back to individuals.</p>
                        <p>For datasets with metabolomics data we would expect all relevant data to be made available in Metabolights, and therefore GigaDB would only host other data files that are created/used in the analysis/project (if any). Where there are no additional files or data to be hosted in GigaDB it is possible we will not generate a dataset in those cases.</p>
                        <p>The basic outline of data that is to be included in a Metabolomics dataset are summarised below</p>
