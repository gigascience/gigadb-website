                <p>We have a commitment to Open Science by freely providing an online database, data and services
                    relating to data contributed from biological and biomedical science experiments by authors and
                    users. We impose no additional restrictions on access to, or use of, the data provided beyond those
                    asserted by the data depositors. </p>
                <p>Datasets associated with GigaScience journal articles are specifically released under a Creative
                    Commons CC0 waiver unless stated otherwise. While <a
                            href="http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0">CC0</a> waives any legal requirement for
                    attribution, crediting the source of research findings and data are cultural norms and expected
                    etiquette for science. In recognition of the extensive effort that underlies these projects, we ask
                    that users appropriately acknowledge the use of any dataset(s). To aid researchers to find, access,
                    and reuse data, we issue citable digital object identifiers for each dataset. Our recommended format
                    for a data citation of each dataset is listed on each page. This is in accordance with the <a
                            href="https://doi.org/10.25490/a97f-egyk">Data Citation Principles</a>. The Open Science
                    policies and practices are only sustainable if scientific credit is generated for all parties
                    involved, and by making dataset citation details available on each dataset we are assisting in
                    developing a global research environment that rewards data sharing.</p>
                <p>Users submitting data agree to not upload viruses or malware, and all users agree not to upload,
                    post, transmit, distribute or otherwise publish on or to the system any materials that contain a
                    software virus or other harmful component.</p>
                <p>We are not liable to you or third parties claiming through you, for any loss or damage, including the
                    consequences of any discontinuity of service.</p>
                <p>While we will retain our commitment to Open Science, we reserve the right to update these Terms of
                    Use. When alterations are inevitable, we will attempt to give reasonable notice of any changes by
                    placing a notice on our website, but you may wish to check each time you use the website. The date
                    of the most recent revision will appear on this, Terms of Use page.</p>

                <p>Any attempt to use our online services to a level that prevents, or looks likely to prevent, us

                <p>As an Open Data repository, depositors must make sure everyone can legally reuse the data they

                    materials created by someone else must have the necessary permissions and attribution to allow
                    sharing in this manner. Publication irrevocably grants anyone the right to use this work under the

                    that all files hosted on our server are given an OSI or similarly open license, if the authors do
                    not expressly provide one, the file(s) will be assumed to be under the most permissive <a

            <h4 style="color: #099242; margin-bottom: 10px;">A note about BGI Data</h4>
            <div class="subsection">
                <p>As one of the world’s largest biological data producers, the BGI’s goal is to maximize the use of its
                    data by providing it to the research community in a timely manner. At the same time, BGI recognizes
                    the need for researchers to be appropriately credited for their scientific contribution and
                    investment in data generation. It is therefore expected that all researchers both honor agreements
                    in line with the <a href="http://www.genome.gov/10506537">Fort Lauderdale</a> and the <a
                            href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7261/full/461168a.html">Toronto
                        International Data Release Workshop</a> data sharing principles and appropriately acknowledge
                    the contributions of others.</p>
                <p>Accordingly, raw data such as individual sequence read traces are submitted to the relevant database
                    as soon as they have exited BGI quality control pipelines. Whole genome sequence assemblies are
                    released as soon as possible following appropriate quality analysis. Our repository contains draft
                    versions of genome sequence assemblies, and we ask that you understand that these represent
                    preliminary data, subject to omissions and errors. In addition, whole genome assemblies are likely
                    to change upon the availability of new data, and our website will document new assembly versions as
                    they are released.</p>
                <p>In recognition of the extensive effort that underlies these projects, we ask that you appropriately
                    acknowledge the use of any preliminary data. To aid researchers to find, access, and reuse data, we
                    have issued citable digital object identifiers for each dataset. Our recommended format for a data
                    citation of each dataset is listed on each page. This recommendation is in accordance with the
                    adopted guidelines by the genome sequencing community in a statement of principles for the
                    distribution and use of large-scale sequencing data: <a

                    have any questions regarding the use of this data, please contact us at <a

                    with these recognized research norms, we request that you contact the relevant dataset contact
                    before publishing analyses of the sequences on a genome scale. We welcome collaborative interaction
                    to provide the community with improved whole genome analyses and annotations.</p>
